# Required Texts

You are required to have the following two texts. These are both translations from the Greek. You *must* have this particular translation for the course (eBooks or PDFs are acceptable):

* Plato, [*Phaedrus*](https://www.amazon.com/Phaedrus-Hackett-Classics-Plato/dp/0872202208/) (trans. Alexander Nehamas, Paul Woodruff)
* Plato, [*Gorgias*](https://www.amazon.com/Gorgias-Hackett-Classics-Plato/dp/0872200167/) (trans. Donald J. Zeyl)

Both texts are included in [*Plato: Complete Works*](https://www.amazon.com/Plato-Complete-Works/dp/0872203492/), if you have that text from another class.

## Assignment Descriptions

### Self-paced Writing Exercises (12)

Each week on Wednesday, you will complete a self-paced writing exercise designed to further your understanding of academic writing and prepare you for the task of completing your final research project. These exercises are in support of this courses "Writing Intensive" designation.

The list of [writing exercises](#writing-exercises) is at the bottom of this document.

#### Grading for Writing Exercises

I will be marking your writing exercises as "satisfactory" and "unsatisfactory." A mark of "unsatisfactory" will be accompanied by comments on how to improve the exercise. If you wish to change an "unsatisfactory" to a "satisfactory," you may revise your document along the lines of my comments and **email me** the updated exercise. Assuming the changes are now "satisfactory," the mark will be changed.

### Position Paper (2)

Twice (in weeks 7 and 10), you will produce a short paper (2-3 pages, double-spaced) that takes a position on a particular selection from one of the texts we have read so far in class.

These papers will cover material that has already been discussed in class but has not been covered by a position paper. The first paper, due at the start of week 6, will cover material from the first five weeks of class. The second paper will cover texts from week 6 through week 11.

These position papers ask you to show insights and raise questions in response to the reading and course discussions. Papers that merely summarize an argument or restate the selected passage will receive a failing grade. You need to explain why the passage in question is thought-provoking, or unsettling, or unclear and suggest how you respond to this challenge.

### Research Project

For a final project, you will be asked to create an artifact that documents the research you have been doing this semester. As a baseline, the artifact should be a 10 page research paper that is well-cited and thoroughly-documented. You can treat the paper as a report-style document, often called a literature review in the business, which is a document reporting on the state of research into a particular topic. This is still a composed essay, so you will need to work out a thesis and draw conclusions.

If, however, you would like to write something more argumentative, you may also complete a thesis-driven essay that argues for a particular point. Is Apuleius more influenced by Aristotle than previously thought? Argue that! Do you see a comparison between St. Augustine and Gorgias no one has noticed before? Argue that! Is there a contemporary text or figure how reminds you of one of the ancient rhetoricians we have studied? Argue that!

Finally, if you would like to explore argumentation outside of academic prose, that is fine. Would you like to write a short story about a medieval initiate monk learning rhetoric for the first time? Cool! Do you want to make a video explaining a Cicero speech that seems relevant to contemporary topics? Do it! If you take the creative route, I would ask you submit a two page paper detailing your thinking in creating the artifact and citing some sources you based your project on.

There is a list of possible topics below, but feel free to propose via email some other topic you would like to explore in your paper.

# Writing Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Introductions

Introduce yourself! For this first writing exercise, please provide the following information:

1. Your name
1. Your pronouns
1. Your major and year
1. Your favorite book and briefly why
1. Your interest in rhetoric or why you took the course
1. Your previous experiences with rhetoric, either at Texas A&M or elsewhere

When you have answered these questions, submit your document on the dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 2 - Definitions of Rhetoric

We talked last week about the origins of the term "rhetoric." This course will concern itself with the mostly messy, often contradictory history of this term. One consequence of this history is that definitions of the term "rhetoric" proliferate. Here are a couple of my favorite:

1. "For he is the best orator who by speaking both teaches, and delights, and moves the minds of his hearers." (Cicero)
1. The Orator is "a good man speaking well." (Quintilian)
1. "The duty and office of Rhetoric is to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the will." (Francis Bacon)
1. "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible." (John Poulakos)

For today's exercise:

1. Having read the above definitions, pick the one you find most compelling ("compelling" here can be good or bad).
	* Write a few paragraphs explaining in detail what it is about this definition that compels you. **Be specific**
	* Use Google to find out a bit about the speaker (making sure you get the correct Francis Bacon; there are two famous people with that name!)
	* Note some sources you used in a paragraph, commenting on what was good or bad about the source (you don't have to use proper citations at this point).
	* Write a paragraph or two explaining if the time period or biographical information clarifies your understanding of the definition. If so, how? If not, why not?

You should have around one to two pages of double-spaced writing at this point. If not, make sure you have explained your position and your research with enough thoroughness. Then submit to the Dropbox on Canvas.
