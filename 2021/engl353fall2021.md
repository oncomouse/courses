## Assignment Descriptions

### Self-paced Writing Exercises (12)

Each week on Wednesday, you will complete a self-paced writing exercise designed to further your understanding of academic writing and prepare you for the task of completing your final research project. These exercises are in support of this courses "Writing Intensive" designation.

The list of [writing exercises](#writing-exercises) is at the bottom of this document.

#### Grading for Writing Exercises

I will be marking your writing exercises as "satisfactory" and "unsatisfactory." A mark of "unsatisfactory" will be accompanied by comments on how to improve the exercise. If you wish to change an "unsatisfactory" to a "satisfactory," you may revise your document along the lines of my comments and **email me** the updated exercise. Assuming the changes are now "satisfactory," the mark will be changed.

### Position Paper (2)

Twice (in weeks 7 and 10), you will produce a short paper (2-3 pages, double-spaced) that takes a position on a particular selection from one of the texts we have read so far in class.

These papers will cover material that has already been discussed in class but has not been covered by a position paper. The first paper, due at the start of week 6, will cover material from the first five weeks of class. The second paper will cover texts from week 6 through week 11.

These position papers ask you to show insights and raise questions in response to the reading and course discussions. Papers that merely summarize an argument or restate the selected passage will receive a failing grade. You need to explain why the passage in question is thought-provoking, or unsettling, or unclear and suggest how you respond to this challenge.

### Research Project

For a final project, you will be asked to create an artifact that documents the research you have been doing this semester. As a baseline, the artifact should be a 10 page research paper that is well-cited and thoroughly-documented. You can treat the paper as a report-style document, often called a literature review in the business, which is a document reporting on the state of research into a particular topic. This is still a composed essay, so you will need to work out a thesis and draw conclusions.

If, however, you would like to write something more argumentative, you may also complete a thesis-driven essay that argues for a particular point. Is Apuleius more influenced by Aristotle than previously thought? Argue that! Do you see a comparison between St. Augustine and Gorgias no one has noticed before? Argue that! Is there a contemporary text or figure how reminds you of one of the ancient rhetoricians we have studied? Argue that!

Finally, if you would like to explore argumentation outside of academic prose, that is fine. Would you like to write a short story about a medieval initiate monk learning rhetoric for the first time? Cool! Do you want to make a video explaining a Cicero speech that seems relevant to contemporary topics? Do it! If you take the creative route, I would ask you submit a two page paper detailing your thinking in creating the artifact and citing some sources you based your project on.

There is a list of possible topics below, but feel free to propose via email some other topic you would like to explore in your paper.

# Writing Exercises

## Exercise 1 - Introductions

Introduce yourself! For this first writing exercise, please provide the following information:

1. Your name
1. Your pronouns
1. Your major and year
1. Your favorite book and briefly why
1. Your interest in rhetoric or why you took the course
1. Your previous experiences with rhetoric, either at Texas A&M or elsewhere

When you have answered these questions, submit your document on the dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 2 - Definitions of Rhetoric

We talked last week about the origins of the term "rhetoric." This course will concern itself with the mostly messy, often contradictory history of this term. One consequence of this history is that definitions of the term "rhetoric" proliferate. Here are a couple of my favorite:

1. "For he is the best orator who by speaking both teaches, and delights, and moves the minds of his hearers." (Cicero)
1. The Orator is "a good man speaking well." (Quintilian)
1. "The duty and office of Rhetoric is to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the will." (Francis Bacon)
1. "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible." (John Poulakos)

For today's exercise:

1. Having read the above definitions, pick the one you find most compelling ("compelling" here can be good or bad).
	* Write a few paragraphs explaining in detail what it is about this definition that compels you. **Be specific**
	* Use Google to find out a bit about the speaker (making sure you get the correct Francis Bacon; there are two famous people with that name!)
	* Note some sources you used in a paragraph, commenting on what was good or bad about the source (you don't have to use proper citations at this point).
	* Write a paragraph or two explaining if the time period or biographical information clarifies your understanding of the definition. If so, how? If not, why not?

You should have around one to two pages of double-spaced writing at this point. If not, make sure you have explained your position and your research with enough thoroughness. Then submit to the Dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 3

Read ["The Cost of Achieving Community: Pericles' Funeral Oration"](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED285234.pdf) by Jim Mackin, which concerns itself with some of the rhetorical aspects of Pericles' speech. What, to your reading, is the most controversial claim made in the text?

Quote the claim in the text (again, not worrying yet about citing it properly). Use a [block quote](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/block-quotations) if the selection is longer than four lines, otherwise quote your selection using quotation marks.

After the quote, explain why you chose it as controversial? Do you agree with the claim? Do you disagree? What criteria helped you decide what was controversial? Did the author signal that this claim was controversial or are you basing your selection off of your personal interests?

Write up your answer to these questions in a 1-2 page set of notes (don't worry about it being a formal essay) and submit to the dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 4

Read ["Discovering a Topic, Preparing for Discussion."](https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/writinghandbook/chapter/2-discovering-a-topic-preparing-for-discussion/)

Think about three topics you could use for the first position paper and analyze them given the rubric described in the above chapter. Which do you think is most effective? Why?

Write up your answer, including the three possible topics, as a 1-2 page collection of notes and submit to the dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 5

Read ["Ordering Evidence, Building an Argument"](https://mlpp.pressbooks.pub/writinghandbook/chapter/ordering-evidence-building-an-argument/)

Given the three topics you outlined in last week's assignments, what kind of evidence would you need to argue for the controversial nature of each? Using the methods described in this chapter, create three rough outlines of the position paper you would write based on each claim.

Now, which one seems like the most compelling? Which will make the strongest first paper? Why?

Along with the three outlines, include some thoughts on the above list of questions and submit the whole thing to the dropbox on Canvas.

*This will be the final writing exercise in preparation for the first position paper. [Writing Exercise 7](#exercise-7) will be peer review for this paper.*

## Exercise 6

With this exercise, we will be shifting to the research paper, to be completed at the end of the semester.

One of the first tasks of a scholar is positioning their work within the conversation. And to do that, a scholar must have some understand of the state of the field. There are many ways to do this, but a quick one is to use various reference works designed to help situate new researchers within a topic.

For this exercise, I have provided on Canvas a chapter from *The Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric* (3rd Edition; 2010) that summarizes work done on the classical period (Greek and Roman rhetoric, which is the topic of the research project). Read over this document, which includes an extensive bibliography, and write up some notes on two topics:

1. What was it like reading this kind of document? Have you read something like this before? Did you find it helpful? Or confusing? What jargon did the document use?
2. What topics interested you? What would you like to know more about? Why?

Submit your notes on these two topics to the dropbox on Canvas.

## Exercise 7

Conducting peer review is an important part of the writing process, even though it often feels like a chore. The reason being that, as we write, we often do not see the parts of our paper that don't make sense or have grammatical errors and so forth because we are so familiar with what we are trying to say that it blocks us from seeing what we did say. Thus, getting someone else to look over our paper can greatly help clarify and improve our argumentation.

For this week's exercise, arrange with two classmates to exchange drafts (you can do this virtually or in person) and read each others' documents over. There is a peer review checklist posted to Canvas. You will complete this document for each of your two peers, provide copies to your two peers, and turn in the checklists you completed to the dropbox on Canvas for credit on this lab.

## Exercise 8

You have been provided a list of [topics](#possible-topics) for the research paper. How are you going to choose which to write about? Becoming familiar with unfamiliar topics is key to starting the research process. Perhaps something I've said in class sparked your interest? Perhaps you encountered something reading from *The Present State of Scholarship in the History of Rhetoric* about which you'd like to know more?

In any case, for this writing exercise, spend some time researching the list of provided topics. *Wikipedia* is an excellent source for starting research, as is [*The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html).

If you have another topic in mind, spend some time with the list nonetheless, but also do some more background work on your proposed topic.

Write up, in the form of notes, an account of your research. What sources did you consult? What else do you want to know?

Conclude by picking a topic (I won't hold you to it at this point) and discussing why you chose what you chose.

## Exercise 9

*Forthcoming*

## Exercise 10

We will be conducting peer review for the second position paper this week. Once again, work with two other classmates to evaluate and improve one another's work.

You will have the same peer review checklist as in Writing Exercise 7 on Canvas.

**In addition to the two reports, you will also submit a document---one or two short paragraphs---, detailing what strategies you adopted this time, if any, to improve your peer review experience, either in soliciting feedback or giving better feedback. What else would you like to try?**

Submit this reflection along with the two checklists you completed for your peers to the dropbox on Canvas.
