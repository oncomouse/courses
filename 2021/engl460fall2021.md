1. 10 Big Questions (Due Each Sunday)
1. Project Proposal
1. Project Artifact
1. Project Reflection

## Assignment Descriptions

### Lab Reports

Each week, on Wednesday, you have a lab exercise. This will be a particular set of tasks derived from the week's discussion topic. The week following the exercise, you will be asked to submit a report of what you did, what you learned, what challenges you faced, and how or if you overcame them. Additionally, you will submit the artifact you were asked to create.

You are not required to complete all lab reports to earn an "A" in this course, however, it is **strongly recommended** you at least attempt all 11 labs.

### Big Questions

At the start of each week (by Sunday night), you will be asked to submit a big question to help guide our weekly discussion. For the first 11 weeks of class, this will be based on the reading. What aspects did you not understand? What do you wish to know more about? What was unclear?

For the final 3 weeks, your question will need to be derived from the work you are doing on your final project. Where are you having challenges? What can we do more? These questions will help seed the discussion in our stand-up meetings, where we will catch up on how our projects are going.

### Project

The major task of this class will be to create some form of digital text that responds to something we have done in class. This is intended to be open-ended and student-drive, so I want you to be as creative as you feel comfortable.

You will be required to generate a proposal for your project in addition to creating the artifact itself.

You may work on this project in groups as large as three, or you may complete the project individually.

The project reflection does need to be completed individually.

#### Project Proposal

**This portion of the project may be done in groups**

For the first part of the project, you or your group will generate a project proposal. This document will briefly outline what you plan to make and include any relevant items such as wireframes, rough draft language, mood boards, or other tools you have created to support your vision for the project.

Additionally, you will deliver a very short, very informal (do not stress about this, please) presentation on the day the proposal is due to inform your classmates of what you are doing and to solicit any feedback

#### Project Artifact

**This portion of the project may be done in groups**

This is the thing in question. It might be a website. It might be a Twitter bot. It might be something entirely other. Your task is to respond to the model of digital writing we have been constructing.

#### Project Reflection

**This portion of the project must be completed individually**

Reflect on what you did for the project. Analyze the work done and comment on strengths and weaknesses. What would you have done differently? What worked well?

If this was a group project, also tell me how the workload was shared and how the team worked.

# Grading

This course will utilize a labor-based model of grading. In place of the traditional grade model, where you produce some arbitrary unit of knowledge and I evaluate it with an equally meaningless number from 1-100, your grade will be determined based on the labor-based rubric below.

When items are submitted, I will read over them and declare the work to be "satisfactory," meeting the standards of the class, or "unsatisfactory," which is work that is deficient in some capacity. In the event of the latter, I will provide you with detailed feedback about how to transform the work into a "satisfactory" product. You will **email** the revised product to me within two weeks of receiving your initial evaluation. If you revise the product incorporating my feedback, the work will be "satisfactory"; if not, the work will be "unsatisfactory" in perpetuity.

Work must be submitted by the indicated due date to be considered satisfactory. The only exception will be in the event of excused absences. Revisions will be accepted up to two weeks after the initial evaluation is posted to Canvas.

## A-level Work

1. Complete at least 10 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 10 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Proposal
1. Complete a Satisfactory Project
1. Complete a Satisfactory Reflection

## B-level Work

1. Complete at least 8 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 8 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Object
1. Complete Either a Satisfactory Proposal or Reflection

## C-level Work

1. Complete at least 6 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 6 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Object

## D & F Grades

These are grades are earned for unsuccessful completion of work in a systematic way, at the discretion of the professor. A "D" denotes some minimal attempt having been made, while an "F" is awarded in the absence of enough satisfactory work to justify passing the course.
