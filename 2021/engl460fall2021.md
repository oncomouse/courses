# Course Description

# Assignments

You are tasked with completing the following units of work in this course:

* 11 Lab Reports
* 14 Big Questions
* 1 Project Proposal
* 1 Project
* 1 Project Reflection

## Assignment Descriptions

### Lab Reports

Each week, on Wednesday, you have a lab exercise. This will be a particular set of tasks derived from the week's discussion topic. The week following the exercise, you will be asked to submit a report of what you did, what you learned, what challenges you faced, how or if you overcame them, and the artifact you were asked to design.

You are not required to complete all lab reports to earn an "A" in this course, however, it is **strongly recommended** you at least attempt all 11 labs.

### Big Questions

At the start of each week (by Sunday night), you will be asked to submit a big question to help guide our weekly discussion. For the first 11 weeks of class, this will be based on the reading. What aspects did you not understand? What do you wish to know more about? What was unclear?

For the final 3 weeks, your question will need to be derived from the work you are doing on your final project. Where are you having challenges? What can we do more? These questions will help seed the discussion in our stand-up meetings, where we will catch up on how our projects are going.

## Contract Grading

This course will utilize contract grading. In place of the traditional grade model, where you produce some arbitrary unit of knowledge and then I evaluate it with an equally meaningless number from 1-100, you will determine the grade you would like to earn in this course, we will agree on a contract governing the steps you will take to earn this grade and the penalties you will incur if you fail to meet these goals, then you will be responsible for managing your completion of the components of this course.

When items are submitted, I will read over them and declare the work to be **"satisfactory"** and meet the standards of the class or that it is **"unsatisfactory"**. In the event of the latter, I will provide you with detailed feedback about how to transform the work into a **"satisfactory"** product. If you revise the product incorporating my feedback, the work will be **"satisfactory"**; if not or if the revision remains below standard, the work will be **"unsatisfactory"** in perpetuity.

### Evaluation

Periodically (as noted on the syllabus), I will ask you to write self-evaluations regarding your progress in fulfilling your contract. You will also be asked to complete a final self-evaluation at the end of the course. **This is a non-negotiable aspect of the contract**.

### Why Are We Doing This?

Grades are despotic. There is a growing body of research suggesting that numerical grading is actually antithetical to learning because it turns the process of developing knowledge and growing as a thinking individual into a terror-driven, anxiety-inducing system of continuous, arbitrary evaluation.

Moreover, it puts you in charge of how you learn. I can offer you the knowledge I possess and the chance to practice the related skills. The rest is up to you.

Cathy Davidson, a noted education expert who advocates contract grading, offers the following:

> The advantage of contract grading is that you, the student, decide how much work you wish to do this semester; if you complete that work on time and satisfactorily, you will receive the grade for which you contracted. This means planning ahead, thinking about all of your obligations and responsibilities this semester and also determining what grade you want or need in this course. The advantage of contract grading to the professor is no whining, no special pleading, on the students part. If you complete the work you contracted for, you get the grade. Done. I respect the student who only needs a C, who has other obligations that preclude doing all of the requirements to earn an A in the course, and who contracts for the C and carries out the contract perfectly. (This is another one of those major life skills: taking responsibility for your own workflow.)

### A-Earning Contract

1. Complete at least 9 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 12 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Proposal
1. Complete a Satisfactory Project
1. Complete a Satisfactory Reflection

### B-Earning Contract

1. Complete at least 7 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 10 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Object
1. Complete Either a Satisfactory Proposal or Reflection

### C-Earning Contract

1. Complete at least 5 Satisfactory Lab Reports
1. Complete at least 8 Satisfactory Reading Questions
1. Complete a Satisfactory Object

### D & F Grades

These are grades are earned for successful completion of a contract in a systematic way, at the discretion of the professor. A "D" denotes some minimal fulfillment of the contract while an "F" is awarded in the absence of enough satisfactory work to justify passing the course. In both cases, the contractual relationship has broken down.
