This week, we'll put our new-found knowledge of CSS to use.

So, if you're keeping up with the exercises, you probably have a site that looks something like this one:

![Unstyled Primer Site](./images/05-starting-off.png)
{:.text-center}

So, we could make something like this:

![Styled Primer Site](./images/05-end-point-1.png)

Or this:

![Styled Primer Site](./images/05-end-point-2.png)

As two examples of how we can build a more amenable layout using just the built-in CSS classes in Primer.

# Some CSS Properties to Look At

Make sure to look at the built-in themes for your theme before you start building new CSS content, but a couple of properties that will likely help are:

* [`list-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style)
* [`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding)
* [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)
* [`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)
* [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)
* [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) (pay special attention to the part talking about `inline-block`, which you will definitely want to use for making `<li>` tags into things that work more like buttons)

# Your Challenge for the Week

I am challenging you to start the process of styling your navigation menu and the categories display on your blog posts. See what you can come up with and write a blog post about your process!
