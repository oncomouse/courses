## Types of Discussion Questions

1. Divergent - Open, having many responses; permits the exploration of diverse perspectives
	* Instead of focusing on writing or the text itself, why, on page 5, does Gunn focus on the reader's response as a means of differentiating between fantasy and SF?
1. Evaluative - Asks respondents to choose or justify a position; compare and contrast two events
	* Does Gunn's continual return to fantasy strike you as relevant to a definition of SF? If so, why? If not, why not?
1. Brainstorm - Generate a list of ideas or viewpoints
	* What are some texts you've read that do not fit Gunn's definition? And why?

## Questions to ask of Peer Questions

1. What type of question have they asked? Why?
1. Is the question open-ended or closed? How could it be made more open-ended?
1. Does the question contain enough background or preamble information?
1. Is the question supported by a selection from the text? Should it have been?
	* Is there enough quoted material?
	* Is there too much?
