* Identify recurring themes across a variety of texts
* Synthesize evidence to establish how themes change between authors and why this matters

## Entry Ticket

Thirty minutes before the start of class on the days in which readings are assigned (Mondays and Wednesdays this semester), you will need to post a discussion question to that week's discussion board on our Canvas site. These questions will help start our conversation and will help to structure our knowledge of the course topic as we move forward.

Each question needs to be generative but can be specific. If you don't understand a particular scene or wonder why the writer chose to portray a particular detail in a particular way, ask. If you notice a theme developing across several readings and find it reflected in this story, ask.

## Position Papers (3)

Three times (in weeks 5, 9, and 13), you will produce a short paper (2-3 pages, double-spaced) that takes a position on a particular selection from one of the texts we have read so far in class.

These papers will cover material that has already been discussed in class but has not been covered by a position paper. The first paper, due at the start of week 5, will cover material from the first four weeks of class. The second paper will cover texts from week 5 through week 8; third covers weeks 10 through the end.

These position papers ask you to show insights and raise questions in response to the reading and course discussions. Papers that merely summarize an argument or restate the selected passage will receive a failing grade. You need to explain why the passage in question is thought-provoking, or unsettling, or unclear and suggest how you respond to this challenge.

## Thematic Analysis (2)

Twice in the semester, you will produce a longer paper (4-5 pages, double-spaced) that analyzes the role of a shared theme across at least two works read to that point in the semester. Any works read during the semester may be included in either paper.

Thematic papers should begin with an introduction of the theme, what is it, how is it discussed, what are the stakes, etc.? The introduction needs to also identify the works to be discussed, identifying the author and providing a **brief** summary of the plot. Your audience for this summary should be someone who has read the work but not recently and needs reminding of the overall nature of the plot (relevant characters, a 1-2 sentence summary of the action, etc).

The body of the paper will use **textual evidence** to illustrate how each text explores or relates to the theme, using the general terms you established in the introduction. You can establish the relationship to theme using a discussion of style, imagery, or plot, or some combination of all three.

Having exemplified the theme in the two (or more) texts, conclude by explaining what important claims can be made about the similarities or differences in treatment by the two (or more) texts: if they each discuss love differently, what can that tell us about the nature of love? If they explore violence the same, what does that tell us? The conclusion should be addressing the larger issues of society in general, opening the argument out to the social arena outside the text, showing how the interplay between the two texts reveals something larger about the world.

# Spring 2021 Policy Addendum

## Campus Safety Measures

To promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, Texas A&amp;M University has adopted policies and practices for the Spring 2021 academic term to limit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to and between classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.):

* Self-monitoring—Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. Students who have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class remotely if that option is available, and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.
* Face Coverings—[Face coverings](https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf) (cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spaces including classrooms, teaching laboratories, common spaces such as lobbies and hallways, public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaces where 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coverings and additional guidance are provided in the [Face Covering policy](https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf) and [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs) available on the [Provost website](https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs).
* Physical Distancing—Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors, and others in course and course-related activities.
* Classroom Ingress/Egress—Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exiting classrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms promptly after course activities have concluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 6-foot physical distancing when waiting to enter classrooms and other instructional spaces.
* To attend a face-to-face class, students must properly wear an approved face covering If a student refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor should ask the student to leave and join the class remotely. If the student does not leave the class, the faculty member should report that student to the [Student Conduct office](https://studentlife.tamu.edu/sco/face-covering-violations/) for sanctions. Additionally, the faculty member may choose to teach that day's class remotely for all students, or dismiss the class in the case of a traditional face to face lecture.

## Personal Illness and Quarantine

Students required to quarantine must participate in courses and course-related activities remotely, if that option is available, and must not attend face-to-face course activities. Students should notify their instructors of the quarantine requirement. Students under quarantine are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they have symptoms that are too severe to participate in course activities.  Students experiencing personal injury or Illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualify for an excused absence ([See Student Rule 7, Section 7.2.2.](https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/)) To receive an excused absence, students must comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in Student Rule 7.
