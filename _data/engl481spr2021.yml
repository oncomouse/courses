term: Spring 2021
number: ENGL 481
title: "Senior Seminar, Gender & SF/F"
description: "This class investigates science fiction that investigates the question of gender. Specifically, if gender is a social norm, the future is an ideal place to investigate the larger ramifications and reconfigurations of its forms. Beginning with a short review of gender theory in a science-fictional context (Firestone, Haraway, Xenofeminism), the class will read works, spanning the history of SF, that interrogate the future as a laboratory for new gender and post-gender imaginings."
