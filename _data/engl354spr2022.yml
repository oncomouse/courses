title: "Modern Rhetorical Theory"
description: |
  This course studies the return of interest in rhetorical theory and rhetorical training in the 20th century. There are three units: 1) we explore various texts that situate modern life (cities, cars, and mass media, especially) as a problem that rhetoric can solve; 2) we look at some theories of persuasion that respond specifically to these various challenges; 3) we use these theories to explore a rhetorical case study.
outcomes:
  - To learn about the development of rhetorical theory during the twentieth century
  - To understand methods of rhetorical analysis
  - To use these methods to understand cultural artifacts
  - To identify problems in communication that persuasion can help solve
