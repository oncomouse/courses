## Assignment Descriptions

These are intended as overviews of the general goals of each assignment. Longer hand-outs will be provided along with discussion of the assignments during class.

### Midterm & Final Exams

These exams will consist entirely in quote identification. You will be given a list of _six_ quotations sourced from the responses we have produced to the texts we have read immediately preceding the test. You will choose _four_ of these quotes and identify:

* Title
* Author
* Context (what's happening when this happens)
* Significance to larger themes

Your identification of the **context** should be around two to three sentences. You need to provide some information about characters who are speaking, plot events, or something else to suggest you have an idea what is happening in the action of the book at the moment in which the quote occurs.

For the **significance** to larger themes, write one well-developed paragraph about why the quote is important to the larger issues raised in the book. Where the context identifies what is happening, this is more about explaining why this quote is important or interesting within the larger context of the work and the way we have been discussing it online.

### Short Papers 1-3

Over the course of the semester, you will be asked to write three (3) short (3-4 page) papers in response to course discussion and the readings we are doing in class.

Papers should be formatted using 12pt, Times New Roman font and double spaced with 1-inch margins.

#### Textual Paper

Pick a scene in one of the texts we have read for class. A scene could be a portion of a chapter (3-4 paragraphs) or a paragraph or even a single sentence, but not an entire story or novel chapter. Discuss the stylistic, thematic, and imagistic content of this scene, while also connecting these issues to larger themes within the novel.

This paper uses internal evidence only (or primarily). You will be quoting material from the section in question and then discussing the style, theme, or imagery of the passage as it relates to the larger theme of the work.

#### Research Paper

Choose one of the texts we have read in class. Conduct research into the publication and authoring history of the piece.

Questions to consider:

1. Where was the piece first published?
	* What is the history of that venue?
1. What else is interesting/important about the publication?
	* Was it later adapted into a novel?
	* Was it an early standalone publication?
	* Was it collected in a short story collection?
1. Was the work typical of the author?
	* Is it an exception because of quality? Topic?
	* What can you learn about how the author worked?
1. When the work was published, what else was happening in SF history?
1. What else was the author doing / working on?
1. Was the work published internationally? When?

You may ask other questions as you research, and you are not required to answer all of these questions (you may find that none of these are helpful).

This paper does not advance an argument per se, but will need a thesis that outlines what you plan to focus on. For instance, "this paper considers 'Black Destroyer' by A.E. van Vogt as a classic example of the kind of story John W. Campbell sought out at *Astounding*" would be perfectly fine as a thesis.

Cite your work using MLA 8 citation.

##### Accessing Library Resources Off Campus:

If you need to access library resources from off campus, you have two options, which both have advantages and disadvantages:

1. Use a VPN to access the TAMU network:
	* [Instructions](https://it.tamu.edu/services/network-and-internet-access/virtual-private-networks/virtual-private-network-vpn/)
1. Use EZProxy to access library resources:
	* ["What is EZProxy?"](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/166882)
	* [Library Instructions](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/50901)
	* ["Configure Google Scholar to access library resources"](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/165955)
	* Use an EZProxy browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezproxy-redirect/gfhnhcbpnnnlefhobdnmhenofhfnnfhi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ezproxy-redirect-foxified/)

Personally, I use an EZProxy browser extension because I can never remember to connect to the VPN and I don't use a lot of other TAMU services from home. If you use a lot of other campus-only services, the VPN may be right for you (campus VPN is also good if you need to access anything A&M related on an unsecure connection, like coffee shop wi-fi).

#### Analysis Paper

Pick two works we have read in the class. Also pick a topic that both have in common (whether this topic is content-driven or stylistic) and discuss how the two works are similar and/or different based on their treatment. As an example, you could pick depictions of space travel in two works we have read and discuss how both authors treat this topic differently; you might conclude that there is a changing understanding of technology based on the passage of time between the two works you are considering.

This paper should demonstrate both outside research and thematic analysis, combining the aspects of both previous papers.

## Embedded Honors

This year, our course consists of an embedded honors section in addition to the regular section. Students in the honors section are required to complete additional work on the final paper (explained below) and to meet with me (individually or as a group) throughout the semester (in office hours or at a time worked out via email). In addition to course content, I would like to discuss Ann Leckie's *Ancillary Justice*, the novel you will be reading for your final paper.

### Additional Requirements for Paper 3

For paper 3, you will produce a 6-10 page paper analyzing a theme found in Ann Leckie's *Ancillary Justice*. You will need to cite textual evidence to support your claim and you will most likely need to find outside research to help your argument along.

### Additional Meeting Times

I am also available for honors meetings the following Wednesday from 11 until 12:

1. September 4
1. September 18
1. October 2
1. October 16
1. October 30




# Course Policies

These are the policies that govern our class. You are responsible for knowing the information on this page *before contacting me regarding policy questions*.

## Student Visiting Hours

At the times listed in the sidebar throughout this site, I am in my office and it is your time to come talk to me about anything related (or unrelated) to class. This time is yours, I am not (supposed to be) doing anything else; you will not be interrupting me. If you have questions about class or have other questions I might be able to answer, please drop by.

## Email Office Hours

I am available to answer email from 9:00am until 5:00pm Monday through Friday. Emails arriving outside of that time will be answered at my earliest convenience, but do not count on a quick answer to emails sent late at night or on the weekends.

## Office Door

If my door is closed and it is not during office hours, please do not knock. I open my door when I'm available to chat outside of office hours, but close my door if I am working and cannot be disturbed.

## Grading

Per university policy, I cannot discuss grades via email. Please visit my office hours if you would like to discuss your grade on an assignment.

### Grade Values

* A 90-100
* B 80-89
* C 70-79
* D 60-69
* F 59 or less

These points will be weighted according to the point breakdown described on [the Assignments page](assignments.html), which will determine your overall final grade.

## Absences

Attendance in class is mandatory and is necessary for you to get what you need out of this course. You may have **2 unexcused absences**. Every absence after 2 will result in a **5 point deduction from your attendance grade**. I must have documentation (doctor’s notes, schedule for sports, etc) for excused absences. Please talk to me in advance if you have any extenuating circumstances.

### Excused Absences

[Student Rule 7](http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07) covers the cases in which absences will be excused and in which late work will be tolerated. The following conditions will be excused:

* Participation in an activity appearing on the university authorized activity list. (see List of Authorized and Sponsored Activities)
* Death or major illness in a student’s immediate family.  Immediate family may include:  mother, father, sister, brother, grandparents, spouse, child, spouse’s child, spouse’s parents, spouse’s grandparents, stepmother, step-father, step-sister, step-brother, step-grandparents, grandchild, step-grandchild, legal guardian, and others as deemed appropriate by faculty member or student’s academic Dean or designee.
* Illness of a dependent family member.
* Participation in legal proceedings or administrative procedures that require a student’s presence.
* Religious holy day. (See Appendix IV.)
* Injury or Illness that is too severe or contagious for the student to attend class.
* Required participation in military duties.
* Mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school which cannot be rescheduled.
* Mandatory participation as a student-athlete in NCAA-sanctioned competition.
* In accordance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Texas A&M University shall treat pregnancy (childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom) and related conditions as a justification for an excused absence for so long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student’s physician.  Requests for excused absence related to pregnancy should be directed to the instructor; questions about Title IX should be directed to the University Title IX Coordinator.

### Note About Excused Absences

In the event of a chronic illness or other sudden condition that will result in significant time away from class, please inform me of the situation before you return to class, so that we can work out how to handle the situation before it becomes an issue.

## Late Work

Under Student Rule 7.4, I am under "under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence." However, I do accept late work and will take off 5 points for every day late. A paper that would have received an 85% that was 3 days late will receive a 70%.

### Extension Policy

Additionally, if you are falling behind on a project and feel that you are not going to finish on time, email me 24 hours before the assignment is due to request an extension. In this email, propose how many additional days you will need to finish the assignment. Requests for extension that do not contain this information will not be honored.

### Technology

In the 21st century, it is unreasonable to accept "my computer died" as an excuse for late work. If you are working on assignments on a computer, please back up your work offsite. Sites such as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) provide space for storing copies of your work; even a USB drive can be enough. I have recently started using [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) and found it to be a great and inexpensive online, automated backup. Save multiple times throughout each work session to both your backup and your computer's copy. In this class, I hold you accountable for making sure your technology is working correctly.

## Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality

Texas A&M University and the College of Liberal Arts are committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment. Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees -- including instructors -- cannot maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community. As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if you do not want the disclosed information to be shared:

* Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting campus.

These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the [Student Counseling Service](https://scs.tamu.edu/).

Students and faculty can report concerning, non-emergency behavior at [http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu](http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu).

## Academic Integrity

**Aggie Honor Code.** "*An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.*" It is the student's responsibility to know the Aggie Honor Code and to understand what constitutes scholastic dishonesty and to avoid it all costs. Anything (particularly plagiarism and cheating on quizzes or projects) that appears to be a violation of the Aggie Honor Code will be reported to the appropriate authorities. For additional information please visit: [http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/](http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/).

Also, the following is a helpful resource for describing kinds and severity of plagiarism. Note this graphic is not from A&M, where rules may differ: [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Infographic_Did-I-Plagiarize1.jpg](http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Infographic_Did-I-Plagiarize1.jpg)

## Students Needing Support Service

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845- 1637. For additional information, visit [http://disability.tamu.edu](http://disability.tamu.edu).

## University Writing Center

The University Writing Center (UWC), located in 214 Evans Library and 205 West Campus
Library, offers one-on-one consultations to writers preparing documents, slides, or oral
presentations. UWC consultations are highly recommended but are not required. Help is available
for all of the steps of the writing and speechwriting process including assistance with brainstorming
ideas, narrowing the topic, creating outlines or drafts, and presenting a speech to an audience.
UWC consultants can help you practice your speech with a real audience or develop visual
presentation aids like slides and handouts. Consultants can also help you improve your
proofreading and editing skills. If you visit the UWC, take a copy of your assignment, a hard copy
of your draft or any notes you may have, as well as any material you need help with. To find out
more about UWC services or to schedule an appointment, call 458-1455, visit the web page at
[http://writingcenter.tamu.edu/](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu/), or stop by in person.

## Diversity Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, perspective, and other background characteristics. I encourage your suggestions about how to improve the value of diversity in this course.
