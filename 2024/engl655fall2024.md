  title: "Contemporary Theories of Rhetoric"
  subtitle: "Screen Time!"
  description: |
    This seminar explores the last 50 years of rhetoric through two claims:

    1. Reality is experienced through screens that function rhetorically.
    2. The work of the rhetorician is one of determining timing.

    We will be exploring these two claims through two bodies of work: canonical texts of 20th- and 21st-century rhetorical theory and media theory that shades and informs the rhetorical work. Participants will be expected to read thoroughly but will come away with an understanding of the shift in rhetorical thinking from linguistic to infrastructural during the period. Authors to be discussed include Kenneth Burke, Thomas Rickert, Richard Lanham, Raymond Williams, Jean Baudrillard, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, and Susan Leigh Star.
  outcomes:
    - To understand the evolution of rhetorical theory during the period of its revival (1950-today)
    - To identify key themes and major conversations within rhetorical theory
    - To formulate an argument that inserts their ideas into one or more of these conversations
    - To articulate key themes in history of rhetoric and digital rhetoric as they relate to broader understandings of rhetorical theory

## Assignment Descriptions

### Statement of Purpose Meeting

At a scheduled time during the first two weeks of class, we will have a one-on-one meeting lasting 30 minutes in which we talk over your research interests, goals for the course, and possible ideas you might wish to explore during the course of the semester.

### Exit Ticket

At the end of each class period, on a 3x5 notecard (provided), please write your name, the date, and the one most interesting thing you learned today in class.

### Weekly Response

Each week, by midnight the night before our seminar meets, you will compose a thoughtful and substantive response to the weekly reading. Rather than a summary of the reading or simply a review of the texts, you should produce something that positions the week's reading within your own goals for the course or broader research agenda. This might take the form of a particular aspect of one text that informs your broader research agenda or of placing the weekly readings in the context of more broadly developing theme you are noticing across the works. Thus, while each individual response may be analytical or comparative in approach, each piece you write should be detailed, specific, and working with quoted textual material. These are not vibes-based pieces, I want to see you extracting textual evidence and using it to support whatever position you are taking on the text in question.

Finally, your response should concluded with a generative, open-ended discussion question that could be posed to the class as a means of stimulating our in-class discussion of the book.

Failure to produce a successful response will result in a 0. You have three (3) make-up responses that will not count toward your total.
