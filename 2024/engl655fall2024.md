  title: "Contemporary Theories of Rhetoric"
  subtitle: "Screen Time!"
  description: |
    This seminar explores the last 50 years of rhetoric through two claims:

    1. Reality is experienced through screens that function rhetorically.
    2. The work of the rhetorician is one of determining timing.

    We will be exploring these two claims through two bodies of work: canonical texts of 20th- and 21st-century rhetorical theory and media theory that shades and informs the rhetorical work. Participants will be expected to read thoroughly but will come away with an understanding of the shift in rhetorical thinking from linguistic to infrastructural during the period. Authors to be discussed include Kenneth Burke, Thomas Rickert, Richard Lanham, Raymond Williams, Jean Baudrillard, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, and Susan Leigh Star.
