## Grading

This course will utilize a labor-based model of grading. In place of the traditional grade model, where you produce some arbitrary unit of knowledge and I evaluate it with an equally meaningless number from 1-100, your grade will be determined based on the labor-based rubric below.

When items are submitted, I will read over them and declare the work to be "satisfactory," meeting the standards of the class, or "unsatisfactory," which is work that is deficient in some capacity. In the event of the latter, I will provide you with detailed feedback about how to transform the work into a "satisfactory" product. You will **email** the revised product to me within two weeks of receiving your initial evaluation. If you revise the product incorporating my feedback, the work will be "satisfactory"; if not, the work will be "unsatisfactory" in perpetuity.

Work must be submitted by the indicated due date to be considered satisfactory. The only exception will be in the event of excused absences. Revisions will be accepted up to two weeks after the initial evaluation is posted to Canvas.

To attain the following grade:

* A: complete four satisfactory assignments
* B: complete three satisfactory assignments
* C: complete two satisfactory assignments
* F: complete one or fewer satisfactory assignments

## Assignment Descriptions

### Short Assignment #1 -- Adaptation

*John Carter*, the 2012 live-action adaptation of *A Princess of Mars*, is largely considered the biggest financial disaster in movie-making history. It is estimated to have lost Disney somewhere between \$113 and \$200 million and ended the career of Rich Ross, the head of Walt Disney Studios at the time. There has been lots written about why the film was a failure, but it can largely be attributed to significant cost overruns and a marketing campaign that wasn't given much to work with (the average person on the street probably could not tell you much about John Carter, compared to, say, Tarzan).

As we've discussed in class, the novel *also* has the problem of being clunky in its plot and characterization and more than a bit racist.

So, given the novel's filmic legacy, how would you adapt *A Princess of Mars*? I won't talk more about possible approaches, but I don't want to influence your approach (I have my own ideas). You are, however, free to adapt the novel however you see fit, in whatever genre and medium you think will work best. Feel free to rework the plot as much or as little as you wish.

To complete the assignment you will need to create

1. Some artifact documenting your adaptation
	* Can be in any form you feel appropriate
	* Can be of any length appropriate
1. A one-page, single-spaced statement on what you adapted and why: justify your adaptation

### Short Assignment #2 -- Style

Several of the authors we've read so far are noted for their distinct styles. For this assignment, I ask you to study one such author's style.

You will need to create three things for this assignment:

1. A short analysis of the three bits in the text in question you consider the most indicative of the author's style. A "bit" can here be defined as anything as short as a sentence and as long as a few paragraphs.
	* You will transcribe (or copy) the three bits, formatting them as block quotes.
	* After each bit, you will provide a paragraph or two of analysis about what elements in the bit make it stylistically distinct and indicative of your understanding of the author's style
	* Finally, you will produce a page stating in your own words what you think the author's style is, defined in terms of imagery, mood, and things like word choice and statistical elements.
1. You will then produce a short piece of creative writing narrating an everyday scene from your life using the style of the author you have studied.

### Short Assignment #3 -- Position

Is *Neuromancer* relevant today? That's it, that's the assignment.

But seriously, Gibson's novel has been hailed as ushering in the digital age for science fiction and for doing lots of important things with the legacy of the new wave, as we've been discussing in class. At the same time, we all basically live in the world Gibson imagined (give or take a few pairs of black vinyl pants), so is the revolutionary accounting of computers we find there still something that matters?

Take a position, for or against, and write a three page, argumentative paper that convinces me one way or another about the rightness of your position.

### Short Assignment #4 -- Fan Fiction

Basically none of the text we have read in this class have what might be called a fandom in the line of *Supernatural*, *Star Trek*, or *Doctor Who* (though I suspect the Wayfarer novels have a strong chance of acquiring a fandom, if they don't already have one). However, the question for this final assignment asks "What if they did?"

I want you to produce a set of artifacts from a hypothetical fandom of any of the texts we have read this semester. Do you want to write a coffee shop au version of "Shambleau"? Can you imagine Pamela Zoline as a series of shitposts? Do you want to make fan art? Memes? A zine?

We'll talk a bit about the historical forms fandom has taken, as well as what fandom means at present.

You can work in groups on this project, just email me about who's in your group.
