## Entry Ticket

Thirty minutes before the start of class on the days in which readings are assigned (Mondays and Wednesdays this semester), you will need to post a discussion question to that week's discussion board on our Canvas site. These questions will help start our conversation and will help to structure our knowledge of the course topic as we move forward.

Each question needs to be generative but can be specific. If you don't understand a particular scene or wonder why the writer chose to portray a particular detail in a particular way, ask. If you notice a theme developing across several readings and find it reflected in this story, ask.

## Position Papers (3)

Three times (in weeks 5, 9, and 13), you will produce a short paper (2-3 pages, double-spaced) that takes a position on a particular selection from one of the texts we have read so far in class.

These papers will cover material that has already been discussed in class but has not been covered by a position paper. The first paper, due at the start of week 5, will cover material from the first four weeks of class. The second paper will cover texts from week 5 through week 8; third covers weeks 10 through the end.

These position papers ask you to show insights and raise questions in response to the reading and course discussions. Papers that merely summarize an argument or restate the selected passage will receive a failing grade. You need to explain why the passage in question is thought-provoking, or unsettling, or unclear and suggest how you respond to this challenge.

## Thematic Analysis

You will produce a longer paper (4-5 pages, double-spaced) that analyzes the role of a shared theme across at least two works read to that point in the semester.

Thematic papers should begin with an introduction of the theme, what is it, how is it discussed, what are the stakes, etc.? The introduction needs to also identify the works to be discussed, identifying the author and providing a **brief** summary of the plot. Your audience for this summary should be someone who has read the work but not recently and needs reminding of the overall nature of the plot (relevant characters, a 1-2 sentence summary of the action, etc).

The body of the paper will use **textual evidence** to illustrate how each text explores or relates to the theme, using the general terms you established in the introduction. You can establish the relationship to theme using a discussion of style, imagery, or plot, or some combination of all three.

Having exemplified the theme in the two (or more) texts, conclude by explaining what important claims can be made about the similarities or differences in treatment by the two (or more) texts: if they each discuss love differently, what can that tell us about the nature of love? If they explore violence the same, what does that tell us? The conclusion should be addressing the larger issues of society in general, opening the argument out to the social arena outside the text, showing how the interplay between the two texts reveals something larger about the world.
