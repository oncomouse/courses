# What is a Text Editor?

Unlike the software we use in our English classes to write (MS Word, Google Docs, etc.), programmers use software called "text editors" to create the source code files that are interpreted by computers into the programs we use today. Most modern text editors are incredibly powerful, if you know how to use them.

For writing in this class, we will be using a text editor called ["Visual Studio Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or "code" or "VScode" for short). Vscode is the latest in a long line of what are called "chorded editors" that make extensive use of shortcut key combinations and on-screen displays to provide a programming with whatever they need to work.

Choosing a text editor is often a highly personal choice for a developer, akin to people who have complex opinions about fountain pens or Moleskine notebooks in long-form writing. If, as the semester goes on, you find VScode is not to your liking, do look into other editors and report to the class if you find something you like.

# Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download ["Visual Studio Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
1. Install the Software
1. When you first launch it, VScode will display a "Welcome" tab that will detail some of the features of the editor. Go through the three walkthroughs: "Get Started With VSCode," "Learn the Fundamentals," and "Boost Your Productivity."
	* Many of the steps in the tutorial require using keyboard shortcuts, so for instance it will ask you to press <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+P</kbd>) to load VScode's Command Palette
	* If you're not familiar with keyboard shortcuts, here's a [tutorial](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts)

# Making It Yours

Part of having an editor is, in additional to being partial to your editor, having your editor configured the way you want. One easy way to do this is by customizing your editor's appearance.

VSCode uses "themes" to change the appearance of the editor to meet a user's preference.

[Read the documentation on changing the theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes) and pick one for your editor. Think about how you use a program and also about what colors look good to you.

# Write Your Lab Report

This week, you'll be writing a short lab report, but still answer all the questions indicated on the syllabus:

* what you did
* what you learned
* what challenges you faced
* how or if you overcame them

Also write a paragraph or two about your impressions of the software so far. Do you like it?

Finally, what theme did you pick? And why? Did you try installing a Marketplace theme? If so, why? If not, why not?
