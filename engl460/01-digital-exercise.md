title: "Writing Lab #2: Being Digital"
---

How much are we digital? I like to joke that I am "very online," though less so since I purged most of my social media accounts. But maybe you aren't? Might you be surprised about how much we use the digital?

As an experiment, I'd like you to spend a few hours tracking every time you encounter a digital system. Remember that things like credit cards and fast-food checkout registers are all digital systems at this point. Not just Tik-Tok.

Keep a log of all your digital usage.

Are you surprised by how much is on your list? How little? Write a bit in your report about how you feel about the experiment and if you've noticed anything new.
