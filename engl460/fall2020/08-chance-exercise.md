This week we read about procedural generation and the ways we can use Tracery to make simple grammars to generate randomized content.

# Tracery Resources

Here are some more resources for Tracery.

* [Tracery Visual Editor](http://tracery.io/editor/)
	* Not, it doesn't save your work; if you reload, you'll lose your place
* [Visual Tutorial](http://www.crystalcodepalace.com/traceryTut.html)
	* Covers more advanced topics than our chapter
* [Another Tracery Visualizer](https://atduskgreg.github.io/bother/tracery.html)
	* This one is strange to my eyes, but it might help
* [Corpora Repository](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora)
	* A collection of corpora, collections of related data
	* You my have to adapt them, but you can use them for Tracery bots

# Weekly Activity

Make a Tracery grammar that tells a short story that is randomized each time the grammar is run. You may try [a fairy tale](https://libguides.mssu.edu/c.php?g=185298&p=1223898) ([this article](https://malcolmsroundtable.com/2013/06/15/the-bare-bones-structure-of-a-fairy-tale/) provides a good overview of Vladimir Propp's theory of fairy tale structure) or [a fable](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-a-fable-in-5-steps#how-to-write-a-fable-in-5-steps), as those are formulaic, easy-to-adapt story structures.

Post the Tracery grammar as a site on Jekyll (or just include the JSON file in a blog post on your site).

As with every exercise in this course, it is less important that you finish something as that you attempt to produce something. I am interested in seeing what you come up with!
