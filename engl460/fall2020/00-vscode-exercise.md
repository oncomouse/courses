## What is a Text Editor?

Unlike the software we use in our English classes to write (MS Word, Google Docs, etc.), programmers use software called "text editors" to create the source code files that are interpreted by computers into the programs we use today. Most modern text editors are incredibly powerful, if you know how to use them.

For writing in this class, we will be using a text editor called ["Visual Studio Code"](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or "code" or "vscode" for short). Vscode is the latest in a long line of what are called "chorded editors" that make extensive use of shortcut key combinations and on-screen displays to provide a programming with whatever they need to work.

Choosing a text editor is often a highly personal choice for a developer, akin to people who have complex opinions about fountain pens or Moleskine notebooks in long-form writing. If, as the semester goes on, you find vscode is not to your liking, do look into other editors and report to the class if you find something you like.
