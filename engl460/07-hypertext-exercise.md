This week's lab will ask you to make a story in *Twine*. To get started, you will need to download *Twine* and familiarize yourself with the syntax used to write stories.

To get started, you will need to visit [Twine's Website](https://twinery.org/). You may use *Twine* online or as a downloaded app; it's up to you.

The default syntax for *Twine* stories is called "Harlowe." Here is a tutorial cover [basic usage of Harlowe in *Twine*](https://gamingthepast.net/simulation-design/twine-interactive-fiction-tool/twine-2-0-harlowe-beginners-guide/), including how to set variables and use those to display different information to users. This [cheatsheet for *Twine*](https://blogs.stockton.edu/textscape/files/2015/04/A-Twine-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) covers formatting, which is similar to Markdown. The [Harlowe manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_heading) covers the full extent of what is possible in Twine.

## Your Challenge

Try to make a *Twine* story that has at least two choices for readers and makes use of a variable. You can make the story more linear or more circular in shape, as you see fit. Include the HTML file alongside your lab report when you have finished it.

The story can be on any topic of your choosing, including any educational or non-fictional topics you might want to explore in hypertext.
