title: "ENGL 460 Lab Reports"
---

There are two elements to a lab report in this course: "what?" and "why?":

* In the **what** section, you will be describing what you did during the lab. Talk through the steps you had to take, going into more detail than would be found in the assignment description. You will also want to include any challenges you face and detailed steps about how you overcame them.
* In the **why** section, reflect on what you learned from the activity. You will need to divide this section into treatments of "observations" and "next steps." On the one hand, observations ask you to move from a literal description of the steps taken in a lab to the concepts that underpin the things you did in lab. On the other, "next steps" needs to open the lab exercise outward: what did you enjoy from this exercise? What would you want to know more about? What skills are you going to do more research into?
