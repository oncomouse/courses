title: "Hands-on Activity 1: What is Data?"
---

One thing that can be done with data is visualization. Data visualization is a fancy term for things such as charts, graphs, and other means of making data clear to non-specialists. There are many ways of visualizing data, with both pros and cons.

But one question we can ask ourselves when we look at a data visualization is "what data structure generated this"?

In addition to some background reading, I've provided you with some sample visualizations. For your activity, look at each of them and try to imagine the data structure and the kinds of data needed to create them. Try your hand at writing a `JSON` or `YAML` file for the visualization in VSCode. Then, ask yourself: what are the advantages and disadvantages of this visualization? Could something else be more effective?

Answer these questions as part of your lab report and submit along with your data file.
