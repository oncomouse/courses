Using the five modes of digital texts:

1. Linguistic
1. Spatial
1. Visual
1. Aural
1. Gestural

Consider the *New York Times* online article, ["Women Who Rock,"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/05/arts/music/25-women-making-best-rock-music-today.html) a feature that explores women-fronted rock bands in America. For each of the five modes, find at least one example in the feature and discuss why you think the authors of the text make use of it. How is it appealing to the particular audience? What affordances are being utilized? Why? Is the use of the mode effective or not?

Compose an informal modal analysis answering these questions and submit that document alongside your typical lab report.
