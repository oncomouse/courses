title: "Hands-on Activity 6: Where Are My Files?"
---

We learned a lot of new things today. So, instead of proposing a new activity, I want you to work on three things:

1. Making sure everything is working the way you want on your blog.
1. Making sure you are comfortable with branching and writing better commit messages on GitHub's website
1. Getting familiar, if you want, with local copies of Jekyll and working VSCode

You still have your regular blog post due on Friday, but you will not have any additional exercises this week.
