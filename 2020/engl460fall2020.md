# Course Learning Outcomes

-

# Class Procedures

This course is entirely **asynchronous**. You will be responsible for completing the work in the course, as the semester progresses.

## Structure of each Week

Though you are perfectly welcome to read ahead and complete work early if you chooose, the class is designed to have the following weekly rhtyhm:

1. **Mondays** -- You have readings available that ask you to think about particular aspects of digital authoring. These readings may take the form of a tutorial or may be considered as more textbook in nature.
1. **Wednesday** -- You have a [hands-on activity](#weekly-hands-on-activities) to complete by Friday. This activity will ask you to explore, in some way, the weekly reading.
1. **Friday** -- By the end of the day, you have a [reflective blog post](#weekly-reflective-blog-posts) due.

## Asynchronous Resources

In addition to this syllabus, we will be using [**Canvas**](#canvas), [**Microsoft Teams**](#microsoft-teams), and a [**Course Blog**](#course-blog) to facilitate class activities.

### Canvas

Will be used for:

1. Sharing resources, including any `.PDF` files you need to read.
1. Distributing grades
1. Turning in materials not posted to your blog

Our course shell is located on [A&M's Canvas site](https://canvas.tamu.edu).

### Microsoft Teams

Will be used for:

1. Communicating about issues that arise in class. This space is for:
	* Me to communicate with you
	* You to communicate with me
	* You to communicate with each other
1. Discussing course materials
1. Coordinating work on the final projects
1. Storing information as we learn it this semester

Check first on Microsoft Teams if you are having issues with some aspect of your weekly work or a problem with a technical issue. Also, if you know the solution to another student's problem, feel free to help!

Our Microsoft Teams site is linked on [Canvas](https://canvas.tamu.edu).

### Course Blog

The course is posted at [https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog](https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog).

It will be used for:

1. [Your individual recaps of previous posts](#semesterly-blog-recap)

## FERPA Privacy Notice

[The Family Educational Records and Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act) gives you a right to privacy in this class. In addition to governing where I can and cannot discuss grades and to whom I can disclose information about your class participation, FERPA also implies that I cannot force you to pubically disclose that you are a student in this class.

This means that if you choose to use your real name on your course blog and as your GitHub account name, you are waiving that portion of your FERPA rights and disclosing that you are a member of this class. If you would prefer to post using an alias or a handle (I'm [oncomouse](https://github.com/oncomouse) on most platforms, for instance) for the blogging portions of this assignment, you are protecting your right to privacy and are more than welcome to do so.

However, if you use an alias, please email it to me so I know who you are.

If you have questions about FERPA and this class, I am happy to speak with you during [Student Visiting Hours](#student-visiting-hours).

## Posting To Your Jekyll Blog

*This will make more sense after the first week of class. It's posted here for later reference.*

We create a new blog post in the [Jekyll tutorial](jekyll-intro.html) (completed during Week 1), but to create additional blog posts, you follow the same general idea. On your blog's GitHub repo, click "Add File" and select "Create New File" from the dropdown. In the "Name your file" input box, type your version of `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, where `YYYY` is the four digit year, `MM` is the two digit month (add a `0` for months less than `10`), and `DD` is the two digit month. `slug` can be whatever you want, but most consist of letters, numbers, and the hyphen character (so `my-first-post` would be a valid slug; `My First Post!` would not).

Copy the following code block to get started and paste it in the editor:

~~~markdown
---
title: Blog Post
layout: post
---
Post
~~~

Any Markdown you post after the second set of three hyphens will be the body of your post. When you are done, click "Commit New File."

<img alt="Creating the first post" src="./images/jk-first-post.gif">
<figcaption>Creating your first blog post.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also edit posts in GitHub. Click on the file in your repo. Find the pencil icon, in the upper right hand corner, next to buttons saying "Raw" and "Blame." Clicking this icon loads the same editing interface as we used to create the file. You can make changes and click "Commit" when done.

Next to the pencil icon you click to edit a post is a trashcan icon. Clicking this will start the process of deleting a post, should you need to remove something.

## Blog Check-In

After completing the [Jekyll Tutorial](./jekyll-intro.html) during the first week, you will need to make a first post on your blog, following the prompt below. Additionally, you will need to DM the URL of your blog to me on [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com). You must DM me this blog post by the end of the day on the first Friday of class.

If you are having problems with your blog, contact me or ask for help from the rest of the class using [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com).

### Prompt

The first post on your blog needs to include some information about yourself. Remember to read over the [FERPA Privacy Notice](#ferpa-privacy-notice) before posting any personal information on your class blog.

1. Any "fun-facts" about yourself you feel comfortable sharing with the class, such as:
	* Class standing
	* Home town
	* Favorite movie, music, video games, etc.
	* Fandoms you belong to
	* Favorite taco
	* **Anything Else**
1. Your reason for taking this course. Interests might include:
	* Wanting to become a better writer
	* An interest in "digital" writing
	* Pursuing a career in writing
	* **Anything Else**

## Weekly Hands-On Activities

*This assignment will be completed individually*

Each week, after completing the assigned reading, you will be given an activity designed to help you apply what you have learned. The results of these activities will be posted to your Jekyll blog. Instructions for each weekly activity will be linked on the [schedule](#schedule).

For a refresher on posting to your blog, see ["Posting To Your Jekyll Blog"](#posting-to-your-jekyll-blog) above.

## Weekly Reflective Blog Posts

*This assignment will be completed individually*

Each week, I ask you to post to your Jekyll blog (which we will be building the first week of class). These posts need to be substantial (500 words) and respond to the week's work.

When we are completely course readings, your blog posts should attempt to provide a real-world example of what we have been talking about. This can be a news article, a video, an image, or any other web artifact that you think illustrates your understanding of what we are talking about this week. Your post should explain how your artifact illustrates 

When we are working on our final projects, you should use your blog posts to reflect on the work you are doing, the challenges you are encountering, and any work that remains to be completed.

For a refresher on posting to your blog, see ["Posting To Your Jekyll Blog"](#posting-to-your-jekyll-blog) above.

## Semesterly Blog Recap

*This assignment will be completed as a class*.

Once in the semester, you will write up a recap of every blog post written that week. These posts are intended to synthesize the week's activities on blogs. What are your classmates writing about? What larger issues can you discern from these patterns? This post will be shared on the course blog.

A recap is not meant to be a complete, point-by-point summary of the week's blog posts. Hit the high points and provide your own interpretation of the themes you see developing in the week's assignments. You may quote from your classmate's blogs and link to them as you see fit. You may be as formal or informal in your voice with these posts as you wish.

These posts need to be roughly 750-1000 words in length.

### Scheduling Your Recap

You can sign-up for a week to recap on Canvas, using the Calendar feature. Each slot is for the Wednesday of the week *following* the week you are to recap. So, the first due date is September 2, which would be for the recap of all blog posts from Week 3. The sign-up slots our for 9:20-10:10, which is when our course would be schedule to meet, but it is not actually due to me until the end of the day.

You can write your blog post initially on your blog. When you are finished, you need to file a [new GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) on the course blog's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/oncomouse/460blog/).

### Creating and Submitting Your Recap

To file a new issue, click on the "Issues" tab. Then click on the "New Issue" button. Click the green "Get Started" button next to the label that reads "Recap Blog Post".

This will load the new issue form with a template for submitting your recap post. You may change the title of the issue to whatever you want and can include any information you need (think of an issue like an email). Where the template says "Paste contents of your posts's markdown file here," you will need to paste the contents of the markdown file you created containing your recap.

The animated GIF below shows how to do this:

## Final Project

*This assignment may be completed individually or as part of a team.*

To apply everything we are going to learn this semester, I ask that you make a thing.

While vague, I want you (or your team) to produce an artifact utilizing the skills we have developed this semester. This may take the form of a blog, a site for an organization, a hypertext, or a bot of some sort. The form your project takes is up to you, but you will need to produce something that lets you further explore the principals of digital authoring we have discussed.

### Proposal

*This portion of the project will be submitted individually or as part of a team.*

The first step in this process will be to research audience expectations and produce a proposal.

Who is likely to use your site? What are they likely to need from looking at your site? How can you organize your site to best allow your users find what they need?

What do other sites in the same genre as yours do? What kind of design elements, what kind of colors, what kind of information hierarchies do these other sites use?

As you explore these and similar questions, you will gain a better understanding of your audience and the type of site they need. When you feel confident in your understanding of these issues, you can produce a proposal.

Your proposal needs to clearly state what you propose to do, how you propose doing so, and identify steps needed to complete this task. I would also like to see some other examples of good (or bad) versions of the kind of site you want to use, along with annotations about what you think they do well and what they might improve upon.

Your proposal will be graded both on the quality of your document and on the detail and feasibility of your plan. Be as specific as possible.

### Object

*This portion of the project will be submitted individually or as part of a team.*

This needs to be the completed object you produce. Don't worry if the result is not as polished as you might have wanted. Webtexts require a lot of polish to get right. I am most interested in seeing how you adapt to the genre conventions you identified in your proposal.

### Reflection

*This portion of the project will be submitted individually, even if you work as part of a team.*

In addition to your object, you (individually if working in a team) will evaluate how the project went. Reflect on the original goals of the proposed project as well as the object you produced. How could things have gone better? What worked well? What skills did you have to acquire? What communication strategies might have been more effective in your group?
