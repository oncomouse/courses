# Course Learning Outcomes

-

# Class Procedures

This course is entirely **asynchronous**. You will be responsible for completing the work in the course, as the semester progresses.

## Structure of each Week

Though you are perfectly welcome to read ahead and complete work early if you chooose, the class is designed to have the following weekly rhtyhm:

1. **Mondays** -- You have readings available that ask you to think about particular aspects of digital authoring. These readings may take the form of a tutorial or may be considered as more textbook in nature.
1. **Wednesday** -- You have a [hands-on activity](#weekly-hands-on-activities) to complete by Friday. This activity will ask you to explore, in some way, the weekly reading.
1. **Friday** -- By the end of the day, you have a [reflective blog post](#weekly-reflective-blog-posts) due.

## Asynchronous Resources

In addition to this syllabus, we will be using **Canvas** and **Microsoft Teams** to facilitate class activities.

**Canvas** will be used for:

1. Sharing resources, including any `.PDF` files you need to read.
1. Distributing grades
1. Turning in materials not posted to your blog

**Microsoft Teams** will be used for:

1. Communicating about issues that arise in class. This space is for:
	* Me to communicate with you
	* You to communicate with me
	* You to communicate with each other
1. Discussing course materials
1. Coordinating work on the final projects
1. Storing information as we learn it this semester

Check first on Microsoft Teams if you are having issues with some aspect of your weekly work or a problem with a technical issue. Also, if you know the solution to another student's problem, feel free to help!

Our Microsoft Teams site is linked on Canvas.

## Course Blog

The course blog is posted at [https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog](https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog). This site is my weekly blog for class and where you will post [your individual recaps of previous posts](#semesterly-blog-recap).

## Weekly Hands-On Activities

## Weekly Reflective Blog Posts

Each week, I ask you to post to your Jekyll blog (which we will be building the first week of class). These posts need to be substantial (500 words) and respond to the week's work.

When we are completely course readings, your blog posts should attempt to provide a real-world example of what we have been talking about. This can be a news article, a video, an image, or any other web artifact that you think illustrates your understanding of what we are talking about this week. Your post should explain how your artifact illustrates 

When we are working on our final projects, you should use your blog posts to reflect

## Semesterly Blog Recap

Once in the semester, you will write up a recap of every blog post written that week. This post will be shared on the course blog.

You can write your blog post initially on your blog. When you are finished, you need to file a [new GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) on the course blog's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/oncomouse/460blog/).

To file a new issue, click on the "Issues" tab. Then click on the "New Issue" button. Click the green "Get Started" button next to the label that reads "Recap Blog Post".

This will load the new issue form with a template for submitting your recap post. You may change the title of the issue to whatever you want and can include any information you need (think of an issue like an email). Where the template says "Paste contents of your posts's markdown file here," you will need to paste the contents of the markdown file you created containing your recap.

The animated GIF below shows how to do this:
