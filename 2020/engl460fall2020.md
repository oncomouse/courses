# Course Learning Outcomes

-

# Class Procedures

This course is entirely **asynchronous**. You will be responsible for completing the work in the course, as the semester progresses.

## Structure of each Week

Though you are perfectly welcome to read ahead and complete work early if you chooose, the class is designed to have the following weekly rhtyhm:

1. **Mondays** -- You have readings available that ask you to think about particular aspects of digital authoring. These readings may take the form of a tutorial or may be considered as more textbook in nature.
1. **Wednesday** -- You have a [hands-on activity](#weekly-hands-on-activities) to complete by Friday. This activity will ask you to explore, in some way, the weekly reading.
1. **Friday** -- By the end of the day, you have a [reflective blog post](#weekly-reflective-blog-posts) due.

## Asynchronous Resources

In addition to this syllabus, we will be using [**Canvas**](#canvas), [**Microsoft Teams**](#microsoft-teams), and a [**Course Blog**](#course-blog) to facilitate class activities.

### Canvas

Will be used for:

1. Sharing resources, including any `.PDF` files you need to read.
1. Distributing grades
1. Turning in materials not posted to your blog

Our course shell is located on [A&M's Canvas site](https://canvas.tamu.edu).

### Microsoft Teams

Will be used for:

1. Communicating about issues that arise in class. This space is for:
	* Me to communicate with you
	* You to communicate with me
	* You to communicate with each other
1. Discussing course materials
1. Coordinating work on the final projects
1. Storing information as we learn it this semester

Check first on Microsoft Teams if you are having issues with some aspect of your weekly work or a problem with a technical issue. Also, if you know the solution to another student's problem, feel free to help!

Our Microsoft Teams site is linked on [Canvas](https://canvas.tamu.edu).

### Course Blog

The course is posted at [https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog](https://oncomouse.github.io/460blog).

It will be used for:

1. [Your individual recaps of previous posts](#semesterly-blog-recap)

## FERPA Privacy Notice

[The Family Educational Records and Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Educational_Rights_and_Privacy_Act) gives you a right to privacy in this class. In addition to governing where I can and cannot discuss grades and to whom I can disclose information about your class participation, FERPA also implies that I cannot force you to pubically disclose that you are a student in this class.

This means that if you choose to use your real name on your course blog and as your GitHub account name, you are waiving that portion of your FERPA rights and disclosing that you are a member of this class. If you would prefer to post using an alias or a handle (I'm [oncomouse](https://github.com/oncomouse) on most platforms, for instance) for the blogging portions of this assignment, you are protecting your right to privacy and are more than welcome to do so.

However, if you use an alias, please email it to me so I know who you are.

If you have questions about FERPA and this class, I am happy to speak with you during [Student Visiting Hours](#student-visiting-hours).

## Posting To Your Jekyll Blog

*This will make more sense after the first week of class. It's posted here for later reference.*

We create a new blog post in the [Jekyll tutorial](jekyll-intro.html) (completed during Week 1), but to create additional blog posts, you follow the same general idea. On your blog's GitHub repo, click "Add File" and select "Create New File" from the dropdown. In the "Name your file" input box, type your version of `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, where `YYYY` is the four digit year, `MM` is the two digit month (add a `0` for months less than `10`), and `DD` is the two digit month. `slug` can be whatever you want, but most consist of letters, numbers, and the hyphen character (so `my-first-post` would be a valid slug; `My First Post!` would not).

Copy the following code block to get started and paste it in the editor:

~~~markdown
---
title: Blog Post
layout: post
---
Post
~~~

Any Markdown you post after the second set of three hyphens will be the body of your post. When you are done, click "Commit New File."

<figcaption>Creating your first blog post.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also edit posts in GitHub. Click on the file in your repo. Find the pencil icon, in the upper right hand corner, next to buttons saying "Raw" and "Blame." Clicking this icon loads the same editing interface as we used to create the file. You can make changes and click "Commit" when done.

Next to the pencil icon you click to edit a post is a trashcan icon. Clicking this will start the process of deleting a post, should you need to remove something.

## Weekly Hands-On Activities

*This assignment will be completed individually*

Each week, after completing the assigned reading, you will be given an activity designed to help you apply what you have learned. The results of these activities will be posted to your Jekyll blog. Instructions for each weekly activity will be linked on the [schedule](#schedule).

For a refresher on posting to your blog, see ["Posting To Your Jekyll Blog"](#posting-to-your-jekyll-blog) above.

## Weekly Reflective Blog Posts

*This assignment will be completed individually*

Each week, I ask you to post to your Jekyll blog (which we will be building the first week of class). These posts need to be substantial (500 words) and respond to the week's work.

When we are completely course readings, your blog posts should attempt to provide a real-world example of what we have been talking about. This can be a news article, a video, an image, or any other web artifact that you think illustrates your understanding of what we are talking about this week. Your post should explain how your artifact illustrates 

When we are working on our final projects, you should use your blog posts to reflect on the work you are doing, the challenges you are encountering, and any work that remains to be completed.

For a refresher on posting to your blog, see ["Posting To Your Jekyll Blog"](#posting-to-your-jekyll-blog) above.

## Semesterly Blog Recap

*This assignment will be completed as a class*.

Once in the semester, you will write up a recap of every blog post written that week. This post will be shared on the course blog.

You can write your blog post initially on your blog. When you are finished, you need to file a [new GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) on the course blog's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/oncomouse/460blog/).

To file a new issue, click on the "Issues" tab. Then click on the "New Issue" button. Click the green "Get Started" button next to the label that reads "Recap Blog Post".

This will load the new issue form with a template for submitting your recap post. You may change the title of the issue to whatever you want and can include any information you need (think of an issue like an email). Where the template says "Paste contents of your posts's markdown file here," you will need to paste the contents of the markdown file you created containing your recap.

The animated GIF below shows how to do this:
