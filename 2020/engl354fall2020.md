  description: |
    This course studies the return of interest in rhetorical theory and rhetorical training in the 20th century. There are three units: 1) we explore various texts that situate modern life (cities, cars, and mass media, especially) as a problem that rhetoric can solve; 2) we look at some theories of persuasion that respond specifically to these various challenges; 3) we use these theories to explore a rhetorical case study.

    This semester, the case study will be on rhetoric and food.

## Discussion Groups

You will be divided into groups of five students. These small discussion groups will be your first point of contact if you have any questions about course content. This will also be the groups for peer-review.

You have a number of group tasks to complete during the semester, outlined below.

I will also allow group sign-up, so if you have a group of friends you would like to work with, feel free to sign-up for a group with them. Otherwise, I will be using the responses to your introduction assignment to group you, as best as I can.

### Twice-Weekly Exit Tickets

For each day there is assigned reading (Mondays & Wednesdays), during the final five minutes of class, you will post a question to our discussion board that you wished had been answered in class. I will use these to structure our 

### Bonus Points: Answer a Question

To earn bonus points, or to make up for a missed discussion, you may answer a class mate's question or provide your own thoughts on the issue, if you are not sure of the exact answer.

### Weekly Wrap-up Posts

On Fridays, you will post the quote you consider the most important from the week's reading. And explain why. This explanation should be roughly 250 words and explain your reasoning for why you think the quote you have chosen is important.

You may use a quotation from the course slides, but you are not required to do so.

### Weekly Wrap-up Comments

Your group discussion board is a place to discuss class issues in small groups. You **should** want to use it to work on your understanding of the material, but you will be required to make at least one comment per week in response to another class mate's post. This comment needs to be substantive, going beyond agreeing or disagreeing but asking for detailed clarification or explaining in more depth the issue around the quote in question.

### Once-a-Semester State of the Board Post

Every two weeks, one of your group members will be appointed leader. It will be the leader's job to facilitate conversation on the board and make sure people are staying on task. At the end of your period as leader, you will post a 500-1000 word wrap-up summarizing your board's discussion of important quotes and questions.

### Peer Review

In advance of both papers, you will be required to read and provide feedback on the draft papers in your groups. This means that you both have to have a reasonably completed draft in advance of the due date for the paper and take the time to read each draft. If a group member fails to turn in a draft by the agreed-upon deadline set by your group, you will not be penalized for not completing a peer review report for your classmate.

If you plan to take an [extension](#extension-policy) on an assignment, negotiate modified peer review deadlines amongst yourselves.

## Paper 1: Contemporary Rhetoric

We have identified a number of problems in the first few decades of the 20th century that make the practice of rhetoric and the study of persuasion crucial for the functioning of a mediated society. What is the single most important issue today that you think require a new theory of persuasion?

In an argumentative essay, discuss your problem, explaining what it is, giving some background on the issue, and why it is a problem that can be addressed through persuasion. You will need to rely on outside sources to support your argument, whether these are scholarly arguments about the topic, technical sources to add background detail, or popular sources to provide examples or to dimensionalize the problem.

## Paper 2: Rhetorical Analysis

For this assignment, you will write what is called a rhetorical analysis. In a rhetorical analysis, the strategies of persuasion of a particular cultural object are evaluated to explain why (or why not) a particular cultural artifact is (or is not successful) at being persuasive. Rhetorical analyses could study speeches by a politician or advertising slogans in a soda commercial; they can look at paintings, books, or anything else that participates in the creation and circulation of cultural myths.

Specifically, I want you to find a cultural object (defined how you want, subject to my approval). Then, I want you to identify the appeals the object is making to its audience. Pay special attention to the theories of rhetoric we have identified this semester.
