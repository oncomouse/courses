title: "ENGL 460 – What is Aleatory Poetry?"
---

# A Definition

# Randomness

The dada artist Tristan Tzara, in one of his several manifestos for the absurdist movement, included a section entitled "To Make a Dadaist Poem." It offers some of the first instructions for what Richard Lanham would call aleatory poetry. Here are Tzara's instructions:

> Take a newspaper.  
> Take some scissors.  
> Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.  
> Cut out the article.  
> Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.  
> Shake gently.  
> Next take out each cutting one after the other.  
> Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.  
> The poem will resemble you.  
> And there you are—an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.

Tzara's instructions are absurd, and, according	to [William S. Burroughs](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/burroughs-cutup.html), another author obsessed with randomness in writing, caused a riot at a Surrealist rally and got Tzara officially barred from that group of experimental artists.

But Tzara's technique continued to be employed by experimental artists throughout the 20th century. In the 21st, randomizing text becomes easier and easier thanks to the computer, which can be made to quickly generate vast quantities of text based on various [digital random number generation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation). This technique is interesting because, where hypertext allows the reader to generate a path through the text and thus generate through reading a particular, novel text, aleatory poetry allows for the creation of novel texts based on chance and randomness.

If hypertext is, at its core, basically a [Choose Your Own Adventure Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure), you can think of aleatory poetry as a game of computerized [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs).

Mentioning both hypertext and aleatory poetry in the context of game playing is especially important, as many games make use of both tools as part of their story-telling. Where, as we saw last week, game designers use Twine to map out a branching story that a user might move through in order to check for glitches in the story structure, [procedurally-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) is used in many video games to increase the reality-effect of games: by making NPCs have slightly different conversations each time a player encounters them, to generating quests and even whole planets new each time a user visits.
