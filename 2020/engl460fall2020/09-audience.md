title: "ENGL 460 â€“ What is Audience?"
---

This final reading will discuss audience, the question of how we adapt a document to an intended set of readers. We will discuss how to be specific in identifying the readers we seek to target with our document, how to identify what our audience needs, and how to give them that while also giving them things we think are important they may not know about.

We will approach the topic of audience first from the perspective of writing and then from the perspective of design.

# Audience and Writing

It is often hard to imagine readers of our work, especially as students in an English major when so many of the things we write have only our professor as the audience and do not exist outside of this simulated environment. However, when you read fiction, in any form, you usually bring expectations to the books that you read. Say you are reading a high fantasy novel, like something by J.R.R. Tolkein; such a work would have heroes going on a quest usually with world-shattering consequences, high stakes, noble sacrifices and lots of battles. Reading a murder mystery, you would expect the novel to open with a crime and the bulk of the novel to be taken up with the interrogation of suspects, the following-up of leads, and the analysis of clues; at the end the perpetrator of the crime will be unmasked.

We have these expectations because authors of many genres of text understand what we, as their readers, want from their texts. We would be dissatisfied with a romance novel whose bulk was taken up with a detailed description of a military campaign against an alien race; similarly, we would be dissatisfied with the reverse, a military SF novel that was mostly about a meet-cute, a misunderstanding, ending with reconciliation and romantic bliss.

The thing about genre is that it doesn't just work in fiction. Most textual genres work this way, by understanding a sense of audience (which is to say, "what you want from the text") and giving it to you. When new genres of texts are first created, we sometimes see push-back by readers who do not fully understand or appreciate the form. Recipe blogs are a classic example of this phenomenon, as the following comic strip illustrates:

![A reader encounters an article about "delicious lasagna" but dies before finishing the story of the blogger's life before the recipe](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-01/9/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-15980-1515536728-1.gif)

Recipe blogs, which often recount some aspect of the blogger's life before getting to the recipe hybridize the personal memoir and the cookbook. This produces delight for readers who enjoy following the ins-and-outs of a particularly evocative blogger's daily life, but can be frustrating when you need a recipe for lasagna.

When thinking about writing, especially in a technical context, scholars like to differentiate between a "real" audience and an "implied" audience. Understanding these two modes of viewing our readers can help us better shape our documents. We can use the example of a food blog as a way to discuss this distinction and hopefully better understand the differences between the two.

## Implied Audience

Genre fiction, as discussed above, often makes heavy use of what is called "implied" reader. The implied reader is one who has a particular role to play or expects a certain set of expectations from the document. Implied readers are also often used in other kinds of writing that have very specific constraints placed upon them by reader expectations. Such genres of writing might include instruction manuals or technical documents such as government forms.

Thinking in terms of implied audience helps us identify broad reader expectations by thinking about texts in terms of ritual interaction. "What sort of reader do I imagine for this document?" is the key question here. This is not to say that we get to pick our readers, but instead it means writing a document that encodes the kind of reader it expects. We mentioned how novelists do this, but we can also think about this in terms of a more everyday genre, such as an instruction manual.

When I want to learn how to work my new toaster, I don't really care about the decisions its designers made when creating it. I want to know how to fix my toaster. I expect a concise document I can quickly glance over to make sure I have the tools I need, before working step-by-step through a set of instructions as I fix my appliance.

I am going to want:

1. Clear short, sentences
1. No prevarication, no complexity, no subordination
1. Illustrations
1. Clearly numbered steps
1. Lots of negative space to indicate where information begins and ends (this is called chunking, which we will see below)

This does not mean I want any of these features if I'm settling into bed at night to read a new novel. We read different documents differently, and effective writers, whether they are writing literary masterpieces or a manual for my broken toaster, encode how I want to read them in the decisions they make.

We can see that the problem with recipe blogs, as we discussed above, lies partly in their having two implied audiences, created by different ways of reading. On the one hand, if I follow a particular recipe blogger, chances are I enjoy their writing, or I enjoy their approach to food, or their photography, or some combination of those things. I read each blog post, as a fan, as a chapter in an unfurling memoir. I want to look at all the photos; I want to read about the blogger's ongoing life.

However, in another scenario, I want to make ramen for dinner, and I want to do it from scratch. I go to a search engine and look for something like "miso ramen from scratch." Recipe blog posts come up as the main results, because this is the main way in which recipes get shared online. My task is not so much to experience a particular blogger as a memoirist, but to compare a collection of reference materials to determine the best recipe. I bring a different set of expectations to the document, I am a reading these documents outside of their implied audience.

This is why many recipe blogs now have a feature to jump straight to the recipe, as it becomes clear that these sites are also serving as a source of reference material.

### Accessing the Implied Reader

Some questions that may give you insight into the implied audience for a document include:

1. What are the circumstances under which the text will be read?
	* Is my reader going to be enjoying this text?
	* Is it going to be read in low light or somewhere such as on a mobile phone?
	* Is my reader going to be a skilled reader?
	* Is my reader going to care to read complex prose even if they are skilled?
1. How have other writers solved this issue?
	* What genre am I writing in?
	* What do good examples of this genre do to set reader expectations?

## Real Audience

Real readers, meanwhile, are less a question of an abstract class or category of reader and, instead, put forth the idea of imagining who readers are as real, specific humans with particular characteristics that must be accounted for. This is an especially strong way to think about audience when one is writing documents for a particular known audience, but it bears fruit as a strategy even when the specific audience is not known in advance.

Thinking in terms of real audience can help adapt to things like local customs or beliefs or prejudices. It can also take into account the kind of jargon---private language shared in a community---that can signal inside and outside of a particular group.

Additionally, real audience is sometimes best understood through user research. Interviews, workplace studies, questionnaires, and surveys all help us better understand the specific needs of the actual people to whom we will be writing.

1. Who can I contact, interview, or observe to better understand my readers?
	* What questions should I ask?
	* What things do I need to measure or understand?

# Audience and Design

## Content Organization

## Design Elements

In addition to content-level decisions that structure our site, design plays an important role in our understanding of audience.

### Color and the Reader

If you were making a site for a traditional German restaurant that served sausage and beer and pretzels, what colors would you expect the website to use? Given user expectations, it's probably not a terrible idea to start [with the colors of the German flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png): red, gold, and black.

We can make this assumption, because we know people have certain expectations for what certain genres of sites will look like. Similarly, websites that deal with patriotism and things associated with US politics will often adopt a red, white, and blue color scheme (this is why most political signs and ads in the US use those three colors, too).

So, color can be a powerful way of signalling a particular implied reader to the user of your site.

Color can also be used to control the mood of a site. Loud and bold colors convey a fun and festive attitude, but high energy may not be right. Similarly, more muted colors can convey certain emotions. Reds tend to compel stronger emotions than blues, which tend to be cool. Earth tones can imply different things, too.

### Your Site's Color Scheme

Choosing colors for your site can be a challenge, but it is an important part of creating your site's identity. Here are some articles and tools that can help you pick a color scheme for your site:

SASS (which Jekyll uses to generate CSS files (remember the `.scss` extension we added to `site.scss`? That stands for "Sassy Cascading StyleSheets")) has some advanced features that can help make working with a color scheme easier:

### Accessibility

There are a lot of nuances to building websites and digital documents for readers with disabilities. A couple of places to start, though, include learning about color contrast---the difference between foreground and background colors---and it's role in accessibility for visually impaired readers:

* [General article on contrast](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/)
* [Resource to test color contrasts](https://accessible-colors.com/)
* [Another contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* [Article on color contrast myths](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/the-myths-of-color-contrast-accessibility/)
	* Emphasizes multiple ways to apply contrast
	* Highlights importance of using multiple cues (text and color, for instance)

There are lots of other ways to improve accessibility, [this article covers how to adapt your site for people with physical or hearing disabilities](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/make-your-website-accessible/).

# Getting Started

Now that we have some idea of what role audience plays in the content and design of a website, we can start to think about how to write the proposal for the final project in this course.

The proposal itself will be a short document (at most five pages of written content, double spaced) that will outline the kind of text you propose to build, who the site will be reaching (think about both real and implied audience when coming up with this), and what steps you will have to take, **in detail**, to create the text.

In addition to the text, any rough drafts of layout, content or functionality, to illustrate your point (including drawings, collages, and mood boards) will help strengthen the proposal and should be included, if they exist.

In terms of concrete steps to take, think of the proposal as the end-point of your brainstorming process, not the beginning. You will most likely create some other working documents that you may not include in the proposal, such as:

1. Audience analysis document
	* Informal
	* Who is the audience?
	* Design expectations?
1. [Wireframe outlines](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/)
	* Hand drawn outlines
	* Set rough ideas for what the site will look like
	* Document what you want to do, not what you can do
1. Color scheme documentation

Once you have a better idea of what you want to make, who you will make it for, and how  you will make it, you can begin to write the proposal.
