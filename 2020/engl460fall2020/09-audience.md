title: "ENGL 460 â€“ What is Audience?"
---

This final reading will discuss audience, the question of how we adapt a document to an intended set of readers. We will discuss how to be specific in identifying the readers we seek to target with our document, how to identify what our audience needs, and how to give them that while also giving them things we think are important they may not know about.

We will approach the topic of audience first from the perspective of writing and then from the perspective of design.

# Audience and Writing

It is often hard to imagine readers of our work, especially as students in an English major when so many of the things we write have only our professor as the audience and do not exist outside of this simulated environment. However, when you read fiction, in any form, you usually bring expectations to the books that you read. Say you are reading a high fantasy novel, like something by J.R.R. Tolkein; such a work would have heroes going on a quest usually with world-shattering consequences, high stakes, noble sacrifices and lots of battles. Reading a murder mystery, you would expect the novel to open with a crime and the bulk of the novel to be taken up with the interrogation of suspects, the following-up of leads, and the analysis of clues; at the end the perpetrator of the crime will be unmasked.

We have these expectations because authors of many genres of text understand what we, as their readers, want from their texts. We would be dissatisfied with a romance novel whose bulk was taken up with a detailed description of a military campaign against an alien race; similarly, we would be dissatisfied with the reverse, a military SF novel that was mostly about a meet-cute, a misunderstanding, ending with reconciliation and romantic bliss.

The thing about genre is that it doesn't just work in fiction. Most textual genres work this way, by understanding a sense of audience (which is to say, "what you want from the text") and giving it to you. When new genres of texts are first created, we sometimes see push-back by readers who do not fully understand or appreciate the form. Recipe blogs are a classic example of this phenomenon, as the following comic strip illustrates:

![A reader encounters an article about "delicious lasagna" but dies before finishing the story of the blogger's life before the recipe](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-01/9/17/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/anigif_sub-buzz-15980-1515536728-1.gif)

Recipe blogs, which often recount some aspect of the blogger's life before getting to the recipe hybridize the personal memoir and the cookbook. This produces delight for readers who enjoy following the ins-and-outs of a particularly evocative blogger's daily life, but can be frustrating when you need a recipe for lasagna.

When thinking about writing, especially in a technical context, scholars like to differentiate between a "real" audience and an "implied" audience. Understanding these two modes of viewing our readers can help us better shape our documents. We can use the example of a food blog as a way to discuss this distinction and hopefully better understand the differences between the two.

## Implied Audience

Genre fiction, as discussed above, often makes heavy use of what is called "implied" reader. The implied reader is one who has a particular role to play or expects a certain set of expectations from the document. Implied readers are also often used in other kinds of writing that have very specific constraints placed upon them by reader expectations. Such genres of writing might include instruction manuals or technical documents such as government forms.

Thinking in terms of implied audience helps us identify broad reader expectations by thinking about texts in terms of ritual interaction. "What sorts of things do my readers want to do with my text?"

## Real Audience

Real readers, meanwhile, are less a question of an abstract class or category of reader and, instead, put forth the idea of imagining who readers are as real, specific humans with particular characteristics that must be accounted for. This is an especially strong way to think about audience when one is writing documents for a particular known audience, but it bears fruit as a strategy even when the specific audience is not known in advance.
