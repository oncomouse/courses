# Overview

Now that we know a little more about files and have some idea of how plain text can be used to encode different kinds of data using file formats, we can begin to learn about how data is formatted for display on the web.

In this chapter, we will explore:

1. Elements of a Document
1. Web Documents: Markdown
1. Semantic Web Documents: HTML

#  Elements of a Document

Think about any document you've ever read. It could be a Word document, a document you created in Google Docs, or an HTML web page you read, on a site such as *Wikipedia*. These documents have certain elements in common, related to how text is formatted and displayed.

Most technical documents use a shared set of elements to convey information quickly and clearly. They are:

1. Lists
1. Headings
1. Images
1. Tables

Additionally, **bold** and *italic* text can be used to add varying degrees of emphasis. When we compose technical documents, we use these elements to drive readers to the information they want, so all these elements are design cues meant to show important information.

<figcaption>The Elements of a Document in MS Word</figcaption>
</figure>

The above figure illustrates document elements in MS Word and how they are intended to function. There is a title at the top that gives overview of the document's purpose or nature or content. A list outlines the major points of the document. We have three level 1 headings that announce major sections of the document (related to the list in the introduction). Those level 1 headings have level 2 headings below them that announce sub-sections, or divisions inside the major divisions.

Given what we know about file formats, we could think about these design elements as a kind of file format for human (rather than machine) readers. Years of reading textbooks and other technical documents has taught us that lists emphasize important groups of data, emphatic formatting such as bold or italic introduce key terms, and increasingly small headings break the document into related sections and subsections.

Of course the visual hierarchy introduced by different headings can also be used as data by a machine. In MS Word, for instance, we can insert a document Table of Contents which generates a visual aid for navigating our document based on the hierarchy of headers we have created. The figure below illustrates one for the word document in the earlier figure:

<figure>
<img src="./images/markup-word-toc.png" alt="A Simple Table of Contents Generated by MS Word">
<figcaption>A Simple Table of Contents Generated by MS Word</figcaption>
</figure>

Word can generate these tables of contents because it can interpret our hierarchy of headers as a kind of nested data structure (like the file system we talked about in the last chapter) starting with the document title as a root, with level 1 headings and level 2 headings in a branch and leaf relationship like a file system tree.

## That But Online

HTML, the language websites are written in, is equipped to describe documents in a similar manner to the visual hierarchy of MS Word. [Click here to see the content of the demo Word document rendered in HTML](./03-markup-example.html).

It looks pretty bad, right? HTML without any styling is pretty rugged. We will talk in a future chapter about how to fix this.

But you can see in that site the same basic principles as before. We have hierarchical information and we use lists and emphasis to highlight important information. We could add some code to our site to generate a table of contents if we wanted, too.

The big difference between HTML and a program like MS Word is what we talked about in the last chapter: HTML is plain text, which means we can look at the source code that our web browser is using to generate the page we are seeing. If you right (or control) click on the simple example page in your browser, there should be a menu option that says something like "View Page Source." Clicking on that will open the document source, showing you the page's HTML. I've included it below as well:

~~~html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Purpose Stated Here</h1>
    <p>This will be an overview of the entire document. To emphasize the things covered, here’s a list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purpose 1</li>
      <li>Purpose 2</li>
      <li>Purpose 3</li>
    </ul>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h1>First Purpose</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the “First Purpose Section”</p>
    <h2>Something Related to First Purpose</h2>
    <p>Information about a new aspect of first purpose. Here is a <strong>key term</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Something Else Related to First Purpose</h2>
    <h1>Second Purpose</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the “Second Purpose Section”</p>
    <h2>Something Related to Second Purpose</h2>
    <h1>Third Purpose</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the “Third Purpose Section”</p>
  </article>
</body>
</html>
~~~

There is a lot of stuff there that we don't see! All those words set off in `<` and `>` characters are called tags. We will talk about them below.

The thing to note here is that if you had to type `<p>` every time you started a paragraph in an essay you were writing and `</p>` every time you finished a paragraph, you would soon grow weary of it. This impatience with typing out these tags is why visual editors such as MS Word (which are referred to as ["WYSIWYG"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors) were first developed.

However, as we will discuss below, some crafty web developers first produced Markup to get around having to use a visual editor for HTML (which, and I cannot emphasize this strongly enough, are all terrible) and to get around having to produce the tags for common document elements such as paragraphs, headers, links, lists, and tables.

Let's talk about Markdown.

#  Simple Plain Text Documents for the Web: Markdown

Here's the same document we have seen in MS Word and HTML rendered in Markdown:

~~~markdown
---
title: Purpose Stated Here
---
This will be an overview of the entire document. To emphasize the things covered, here’s a list:

1. Purpose 1
1. Purpose 2
1. Purpose 3

# First Purpose

Welcome to the "First Purpose Section"

## Something Related to First Purpose

Information about a new aspect of first purpose. Here is a **key term**.

## Something Else Related to First Purpose

# Second Purpose

Welcome to the "Second Purpose Section"

## Something Related to Second Purpose

# Third Purpose

Welcome to the "Third Purpose Section"
~~~

That is much simpler!

Markdown works by assuming you are writing a paragraph, so any block of text set off by a blank line defaults to being tagged as a paragraph.

## Block Elements

In Markdown, a paragraph is the simplest form of a "block". A block is any group of linked elements. Other blocks in Markdown include:

1. Headings
1. Lists
	* Bulleted (or Unordered)
	* Numbered (or Ordered)
1. Blockquotes
	* Used to quote material from another source
1. Code
	* Used to show computer code
1. Images
1. Rules

Blocks that are not paragraphs (lists and blockquotes) are formatted by starting each line of the block with a special character, indicating its function.

### Headings

A **heading** can be given a hierarchical level as in HTML and MS Word. Like those platforms you can define headings from 1 (the top-most hierarchy) through 6 (the lowest). To define a header, begin a block with a number of octothorpes (`#`) equal to the heading level followed by a space. So a block that starts `# ` will be a level 1 heading, while a block that starts with `#### ` will be a level 4 heading.

~~~markdown
# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

##### Level 5 Heading

###### Level 6 Heading
~~~

The above code will produce:

# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

##### Level 5 Heading

###### Level 6 Heading

### Lists

A **list** is either started with an asterisk (`*`) or a number (`1.`). Each new line in the block is a new list item. With ordered lists, the numbers can be sequential (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc.) but it is not required. To facilitate ease of use, most Markdown writers just number everything one (`1.`) so if you change the order of your bullet points, you don't have to renumber everything. If your list is multilevel, you can indent the sub points using a tab or multiple spaces before the heading. You can also mix ordered and unordered lists at different indentation levels:

~~~markdown
1. Numbered List
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
~~~

The above code produces:

1. Numbered List
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
1. Numbered List

### Blockquotes

A **blockquote** is started with a greater than sign (`>`). Some Markdown writers like to insert new lines in their paragraphs every 80 characters, to facilitate orderly source code. This works in paragraphs, but in a block quote, if you do so, each line of the block quote must start with `>`. Here's an example:

~~~markdown
> Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a
>new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
>are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
>that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We
>are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion
>of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives,
>that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
>do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate—we
>cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
>have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
>little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
>they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
>unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It
>is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
>us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
>which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly
>resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under
>God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by
>the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
>
> --- Abraham Lincoln
~~~

This will produce:

> Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a
>new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
>are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
>that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We
>are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion

>the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
>
> --- Abraham Lincoln

### Code Blocks

A **code** block is originally defined by starting a block line with tab or 4 spaces. So, to include some Markdown source in our document, we could use the following code:

~~~markdown
	1. Numbered List
		* Unordered Sublist
		* Unordered Sublist
		* Unordered Sublist
	1. Numbered List
		1. Ordered Sublist
		1. Ordered Sublist
		1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Numbered List
~~~

Would produce:

	1. Numbered List
		* Unordered Sublist
		* Unordered Sublist
		* Unordered Sublist
	1. Numbered List
		1. Ordered Sublist
		1. Ordered Sublist
		1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Numbered List

#### Fenced Code Blocks

The one aspect everyone hated about [the original Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) was using tabs to produce code. Later versions of Markdown implemented something called a fenced code block. These are much easier to work with, though they break the original understanding of blocks as being clusters of lines starting with special characters.

To define a fenced code block, start a block with either three tildes (`~`) or three back ticks (`` ` ``) on a line by itself and end the block with the same, so:

~~~markdown
```
1. Numbered List
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
```
~~~

Would become:

```
1. Numbered List
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
	* Unordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
	1. Ordered Sublist
1. Numbered List
```

Though not part of the original specification for Markdown, this is pretty widely supported and much easier than the original syntax.

### Rules

Finally, Markdown lets you define horizontal lines, called **rules**, in the standard. A rule is another special block in Markdown. It consists of three hyphens (`---`) on a line by themselves.

~~~markdown

And that's it for block elements!

## Span Elements

Alongside blocks, Markdown defines spans. Spans modify content inside of blocks. These elements include:

1. Italic
1. Bold
1. In-line Code
1. Links
1. Images

### Italic

As we will talk about in the section on HTML, **italic** is technically defined as "emphasis" in Markdown. In practice, emphasis is usually formatted as *italic* font, but it need not be. To produce emphasized text, surround the text you wish to emphasize with single asterisks (`*`).

~~~markdown
Here's a paragraph with an *emphasized group of words*.
~~~

Which will produce:

Here's a paragraph with an *emphasized group of words*.

### Bold

Similar to emphasis, **bold** is technically defined as "strong emphasis" because it may not always be formatted as **bold**, however it usually is. To produce strongly emphasized text, surround the text you wish to strongly emphasize with double asterisks (`**`).

~~~markdown
Here's a paragraph with a **strongly emphasized group of words**.
~~~

Which will produce:

Here's a paragraph with a **strongly emphasized group of words**.

### In-line Code

You can also use **code** inside of other blocks, such as blockquotes, lists, or paragraphs. To do so, surround the text you wish to mark as code with single back ticks (`` ` ``).

~~~markdown
This paragraph contains some code, `**Markdown strong emphasis**`.
~~~

Which will produce:

This paragraph contains some code, `**Markdown strong emphasis**`.

### Links

A **link** can be added to a Markdown document by surrounding the text one wants to make a link with square brackets (`[` and `]`). Outside the closing bracket (`]`), add parentheses (`(` and `)`) surrounding the URL.

~~~markdown
This paragraph [contains a link to my website](https://andrew.pilsch.com).
~~~

Which will produce:

This paragraph [contains a link to my website](https://andrew.pilsch.com).

*Warning:* Make sure to include any punctuation that follows the link outside of the URL. A stray period in a URL will make your link not work correctly.

### Images

An **image** is a link that starts with an exclamation point (`!`) and then contains a link (which we will talk about below). Unlike a link, the display text becomes a textual description of the image (which is crucial for building websites accessible to blind users), while the URL is the location of the image:

~~~markdown
![An image of the George R.R. Martin Papers in Texas A&M's Cushing Library](https://oncomouse-demo.github.io/about/IMG_4192.png)
~~~

Which will produce:

![An image of the George R.R. Martin Papers in Texas A&M's Cushing Library](https://oncomouse-demo.github.io/about/IMG_4192.png)

This syntax is the same as the link syntax and is a deliberate choice made by the original  designers of Markdown to emphasize the importance of textual descriptions of images for accessibility purposes.

## A Note on the Name "Markdown"

You may have noticed this chapter is on "Markup" and the language you have just learned (!!) is called "Markdown." What's up with that?

"Markup" is a noun and a verb in computer culture. It means to use a predefined set of special characters (like the block and span indicators we just learned for Markdown), called a markup language, to transform a plain text document into more meaningful data for computers to read. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is considered to be a thorough if unpleasant way of describing data to a computer. Markdown, in contrast, was an attempt to simplify content creation in web environments, so it's a de-escalated version of a markup language, hence Markdown.

# Semantic Web Markup: HTML

Given that Markdown is simple and straight-forward, why would anyone ever write anything in HTML?
