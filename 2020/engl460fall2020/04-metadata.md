title: "ENGL 460 â€“ What is Metadata?"
---

# Overview

Last week, we learned how to use plain text markup formats to create web content using HTML and Markdown. This week, we will take a small step back and discuss how markup languages also allow us to define "metadata" which is "data about data." This concept allows us to not only define content, as we have already done, but to describe that content in ways that are meaningful to both humans and machines.

In this chapter, we will learn:

1. Definition of metadata
1. How to define metadata in Jekyll
1. How to define metadata in HTML
1. Use-case for metadata: SEO
