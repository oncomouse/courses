# Hypertext Games

Sometimes also called interactive fiction, hypertext-based games have become increasingly popular, especially in indie game circles. Here are some examples of games that use hypertext to create a variety of experiences, from scary to tragic to cute:

* [Space Frog](https://npckc.itch.io/space-frog)
* [Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html)
* [A Tale Of Crowns](https://cherrypistol.itch.io/a-tale-of-crowns)
* [Beneath Floes](https://bravemule.itch.io/beneathfloes)

More examples can be found on [itch.io's list of popular games](https://itch.io/games/made-with-twine).

# Twine

All of the above games were made use [Twine](https://twinery.org/), a program that makes it simple to create interactive fiction and games. Twine is built around HTML and CSS, and also uses a lot of syntax similar to Markdown, to make it easy to create interactive games.
